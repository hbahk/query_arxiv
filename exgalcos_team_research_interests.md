## Galaxy Clusters (SPHEREx + Kinematics) : Hyeonguk Bahk
Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, are key to understanding cosmic evolution. These “cosmic metropolises” are not just collections of galaxies; they are laboratories for studying the composition of the Universe, including the mysterious dark matter and dark energy that elude direct detection.

We focus on the dynamics within these clusters, analyzing the kinematics of the galaxies to determine the mass of the clusters. We use velocity measurements from telescopes such as Gemini and Hectospec/MMT, together with data from X-ray observations and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in the cosmic microwave background.

The upcoming SPHEREx mission will revolutionize this field by mapping the sky in the near-infrared, providing redshifts for about 301 million galaxies. This massive dataset will include about 100,000 galaxies within clusters, allowing unparalleled studies of dark matter, dark energy, and galaxy evolution in the most crowded regions of the Universe. We are planning the cluster analyses using the SPHEREx data to prepare and optimize its unique data set for studies of cluster cosmology and galaxy evolution.

## Galaxy Rotation Curves : Daeun Jeong
Recent studies have found the diverse rotation curves of galaxies using observational data. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to reproduce the observational results and to figure out the cause of the diverse rotation curves. We successfully reproduce the observational results of Yoon et al. 2021, showing the relation between the shape of rotation curves and galaxy properties. The outer slope of the rotation curves decreases as galaxies are more massive, and increases as galaxies are more disky. There is a hint that the dark matter fraction plays an important role in determining the outer slope of the rotation curves.

## ODIN (High-z LSS) : Sanghyuk Im
ODIN (High-z LSS). One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrow-bands (ODIN) survey is an ongoing project to identify Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshifts 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 using three custom narrow-band filters. We will also identify protoclusters, Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs), and Lyman alpha blobs (LABs), and study their physical properties and their relation to large-scale structures. The observations are almost complete (as of March 2024), and the first science paper on the relationship between LABs and the cosmic web has recently been published (see the Figure below; Ramakrishnan et al. 2023). For an overview of the ODIN survey, please see Lee et al. 2024 and Firestone et al. 2023.

## Milky Way (GAIA + dark matter subhalos): Yigon Kim
Dark matter (DM) is one of the key ingredients of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model. It provides the basis for the current structure of the universe in the form of halos and subhalos. Not only each halos and subhalos can include baryonic matters within it, but also affect them by the gravity. This model proposes a nice explanation for many observations, such as the galactic rotation curve, the peculiar velocities of galaxies in clusters, and so on.

However, since DM tends not to interact with baryonic matter, we are limited in our ability to probe its nature directly, including its spatial distribution. One way could be to follow the motion of baryonic matter within DM halos and subhalos. Once we achieve the acceleration of baryonic matter, we can construct the gravitational potential around it, and then finally map the mass distribution.

In our lab we aim to use the Deep Learning (DL) technique. This method has previously been used by Hong+2021 to map the DM distribution at the cluster scale with the density and peculiar velocity of galaxies. We focus on the galaxy scale, especially the Milky Way galaxy, using the density and proper motion of stars as proxies for DM subhalos within a galaxy.

GAIA is providing one of the most valuable data releases for this study. GAIA is an astrometry space telescope operated by the European Space Agency. It provides precise information on the positions and motions of up to a billion objects in the Milky Way. The vast amount of data and the precision of the results allow us to understand the spatial and kinematic information within the Milky Way even better than before.

## Dark galaxy (Simulations + Observations) : Gain Lee
Dark galaxies, with little or no stars, are predicted by the hierarchical galaxy formation model within Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology. Detecting and confirming them by observation is challenging due to their faintness. Our research delves into the origin, evolution, and various properties of dark galaxies through simulations. Additionally, we aim to identify them in HI surveys, particularly those without optical counterparts, thereby connecting simulation with observation.

## Cosmological Simulations (Hydro + Multiverse) : Minseong Kwon
The ΛCDM model predicts that our universe consists of a large fraction of unknown dark matter and dark energy, and simulations are invaluable tools for testing these unseen components.

Our team is involved in a wide range of research on simulations from their development to their execution and analysis. We currently developing a novel hydrodynamical code for cosmological simulations and running the largest ΛCDM N-body simulations(Horizon Run Dark Energy; HRDE). We also running simulations with different dark energy equation of state(w) to test the properties of dark energy with the CPL model (Multiverse).

## Alternative Theories of Gravity : Sanghyeon Han
While ΛCDM cosmology has successfully described our Universe, the elusive physical origin and characteristics of dark matter, a fundamental component, remain poorly understood despite its ubiquitous presence. This enigma prompts a reevaluation of dark matter through modifications to the underlying theory of gravity. One such endeavor involves the introduction of entropic gravity and its application to cosmological theory. In our research, we aim to investigate the validity of emergent gravity on the galactic scale. This scale is particularly pertinent for studying modified gravity as it allows us to focus solely on gravitational interactions, with minimal influence from complex baryonic physics. Beginning with an exploration of galactic dynamics under emergent gravity, we aspire to extend the scope of this new theory to encompass much larger scales.

## A-SPEC/K-SPEC (Survey + Instrument) : Dongkok Kim
The K-SPEC project aims to develop a multi-object spectrograph (MOS) system for the all-sky spectroscopic survey, A-SPEC. As part of K-SPEC, we plan to install the MOS system at the KMTNet telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia, containing 169 fibers in a 6-square-degree field of view. The primary targets of the survey will be nearby(Ks<13.75) galaxies, which will provide a comprehensive view of our local universe.
