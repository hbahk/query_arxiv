      "  - Studies of surface brightness (SB) fluctuations in the intracluster medium (ICM) present an indirect estimate of turbulent pressure support and associated Mach numbers. While high resolution X-ray spectroscopy offer means to directly constrain line of sight gas motions, including those due to turbulence, such observations are relatively expensive and will be limited to nearby, bright clusters. In this respect, SB fluctuations are the most economical means to constrain turbulent motions at large cluster radii across a range of redshifts and masses.   To forecast what current and future X-ray and SZ facilities may achieve in SB fluctuation studies, I review and synthesize matters of accuracy and precision with respect to calculating power spectra of SB fluctuations, from which turbulent properties are derived. Balance concerns of power spectrum accuracy and precision across a range of spatial scales, I propose the use of three annuli with: [0,0.4] $R_{500}$, [0.4,1] $R_{500}$, and [1,1.5] $R_{500}$. Adopting these three regions, I calculate the uncertainty in the hydrostatic mass bias, $\\sigma_{b_{\\mathcal{M}}}$, can be achieved for various instruments in several scenarios. I find that $\\textit{Lynx}$ and AtLAST are competitive in their constraints at $R_{500}$, while AtLAST should perform better when constraining $\\sigma_{b_{\\mathcal{M}}}$ at $R_{200}$.\n",

The clusters' evolution is computed using ${\\tt NBODY6\\!+\\!+GPU}$, including the effects of the tidal field of the galaxy, the kicks of black hole mergers and orbit-averaged energy loss by gravitational radiation of binaries. We investigate clusters with four initial mass distributions, three of which attempt to model a generic PBH scenario using a lognormal mass distribution and a fourth one that can be directly linked to a monochromatic PBH scenario when accretion is considered. More specifically, we dive into the clusters' internal dynamics, describing their expansion and evaporation, along with the resultant binary black hole mergers. We also compare several simulations with and without black hole merger kicks and find modelling implications for the probability of hierarchical mergers.\n",

      "  - During cluster assembly, a cluster's virialization process leaves behind signatures that can provide information on its dynamical state. However, no clear consensus yet exists on the best way to achieve this. Therefore, we attempt to derive improved recipes for classifying the dynamical state of clusters in observations using cosmological simulations. Cluster halo mass and their subhalos' mass are used to $ 10^{14}M_{\\odot} h^{-1}$ and $10^{10}M_{\\odot} h^{-1}$ to calculate five independent dynamical state indicators. We experiment with recipes by combining two to four indicators for detecting specific merger stages like recent and ancient mergers. These recipes are made by plotting merging clusters and a control sample of relaxed clusters in multiple indicators parameter space, and then applying a rotation matrix method to derive the best way to separate mergers from the control sample. The success of the recipe is quantified using the success rate and the overlap percentage of the merger and control histograms along the newly rotated $x$-axis. This provides us with recipes using different numbers of combined indicators and for different merger stage. Among the recipes, the stellar mass gap and center offset are the first and second most dominant of the indicators, and using more indicators improves the effectiveness of the recipe. When applied to observations, our results show good agreement with literature values of cluster dynamical state.\n",

      "  - The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will deliver weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering surveys that can be used to constrain the standard cosmological model and extensions thereof. We present forecasts from the combination of these surveys on the sensitivity to cosmological parameters including the summed neutrino mass $M_\\nu$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\\rm eff}$ in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario and in a scenario with dynamical dark energy ($w_0 w_a$CDM). We compare the accuracy of different algorithms predicting the nonlinear matter power spectrum for such models. We then validate several pipelines for Fisher matrix and MCMC forecasts, using different theory codes, algorithms for numerical derivatives, and assumptions concerning the non-linear cut-off scale. The Euclid primary probes alone will reach a sensitivity of $\\sigma(M_\\nu)=$56meV in the $\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$ model, whereas the combination with CMB data from Planck is expected to achieve $\\sigma(M_\\nu)=$23meV and raise the evidence for a non-zero neutrino mass to at least the $2.6\\sigma$ level. This can be pushed to a $4\\sigma$ detection if future CMB data from LiteBIRD and CMB Stage-IV are included. In combination with Planck, Euclid will also deliver tight constraints on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}< 0.144$ (95%CL) in the $\\Lambda$CDM+$M_\\nu$+$N_{\\rm eff}$ model, or $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}< 0.063$ when future CMB data are included. When floating $(w_0, w_a)$, we find that the sensitivity to $N_{\\rm eff}$ remains stable, while that to $M_\\nu$ degrades at most by a factor 2. This work illustrates the complementarity between the Euclid spectroscopic and imaging/photometric surveys and between Euclid and CMB constraints. Euclid will have a great potential for measuring the neutrino mass and excluding well-motivated scenarios with additional relativistic particles.\n",

      "  - Binary black holes (BBHs) born from the evolution of Population III (Pop. III) stars are one of the main high-redshift targets for next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Their predicted initial mass function and lack of metals make them the ideal progenitors of black holes above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap, i.e. with a mass higher than $\\approx{}134$ (241) M$_\\odot$ for stars that become (do not become) chemically homogeneous during their evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of cluster dynamics on the mass function of BBHs born from Pop. III stars, by considering the main uncertainties on Pop. III star mass function, orbital properties of binary systems, star cluster's mass and disruption time. In our dynamical models, at least $\\sim$5% and up to 100% BBH mergers in Pop. III star clusters have primary mass $m_1$ above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap. In contrast, only $\\lesssim {} 3$% isolated BBH mergers have primary mass above the gap, unless their progenitors evolved as chemically homogeneous stars. The lack of systems with primary and/or secondary mass inside the gap defines a zone of avoidance with sharp boundaries in the primary mass - mass ratio plane. Finally, we estimate the merger rate density of BBHs and, in the most optimistic case, we find a maximum of $\\mathcal{R}\\approx200\\,{\\rm Gpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z\\sim15$ for BBHs formed via dynamical capture. For comparison, the merger rate density of isolated Pop. III BBHs is $\\mathcal{R}\\leq{}10\\,{\\rm Gpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}}$, for the same model of Pop. III star formation history.\n",

      "  - Black holes have been found over a wide range of masses, from stellar remnants with masses of 5-150 solar masses (Msun), to those found at the centers of galaxies with $M>10^5$ Msun. However, only a few debated candidate black holes exist between 150 and $10^5$ Msun. Determining the population of these intermediate-mass black holes is an important step towards understanding supermassive black hole formation in the early universe. Several studies have claimed the detection of a central black hole in $\\omega$ Centauri, the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster. However, these studies have been questioned due to the possible mass contribution of stellar mass black holes, their sensitivity to the cluster center, and the lack of fast-moving stars above the escape velocity. Here we report observations of seven fast-moving stars in the central 3 arcseconds (0.08 pc) of $\\omega$ Centauri. The velocities of the fast-moving stars are significantly higher than the expected central escape velocity of the star cluster, so their presence can only be explained by being bound to a massive black hole. From the velocities alone, we can infer a firm lower limit of the black hole mass of $\\sim$8,200 Msun, making this a compelling candidate for an intermediate-mass black hole in the local universe.\n",

      "  - The study of their morphological coherence allows us to obtain a better understanding of the morphological evolution of open clusters. We employed the ellipsoid fitting method to delineate the 3D spatial structure of the sample clusters while using the morphological dislocation (MD) defined in our previous work and the ellipticity ratio (ER) of the clusters' inner and outer structures to characterize the morphological coherence of the sample clusters. The results show an inverse correlation between the ER of the sample clusters and the number of their members, indicating that sample clusters with a much more elliptical external morphology than internal shape generally tend to host a large number of members. Meanwhile, a slight shrinking of the MD of the sample clusters with their members' number may shed light on the significant role of the gravitational binding of the sample clusters in maintaining their morphological stability. Moreover, there are no correlations between the MD and ER of the sample clusters and their age. They are also not significantly correlated with the X-axis, the Y-axis, their orbital eccentricities, and the radial and vertical forces on them. However, the ER of the sample clusters displays some fluctuations in the distributions between it and the above covariates, implying that the morphologies of the sample clusters are sensitive to the external environment if sample effects are not taken into account. Finally, the analysis of the 3D spatial shapes of sample clusters with a small ER or a large ER demonstrates that the number of members lays an important foundation for forming a dense internal system for sample clusters. At the same time, the MD of the sample clusters can serve well as an indicator of their morphological stability, which is built upon a certain amount of member stars.\n",

We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning which are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.\n",

      "  - We study the viability of using power spectrum clustering wedges as summary statistics of 21cm surveys during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). For observations in a wide redshift range $z\\sim 7-9$ corresponding to a line-of-sight scale of $\\sim 500$Mpc, the power spectrum is subject to anisotropic effects due to the evolution along the light-of-sight. Information on the physics of reionization can be extracted from the anisotropy using the power spectrum multipoles. Signals of the power spectrum monopole are highly correlated at scales smaller than the typical ionization bubble, which can be disentangled by including higher-order multipoles. By simulating observations of the low frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory, we find that the sampling of the cylindrical wavenumber $k$-space is highly non-uniform due to the baseline distribution, i.e. the distribution of antenna pairs sampling different transverse ${k}_\\perp$ scales. Measurements in clustering wedges partition the cylindrical $k$-space into different radial $k_\\parallel$ scales, and can be used for isolating parts of $k$-space with relatively uniform sampling, allowing for more precise parameter inference. Using Fisher Matrix forecasts, we find that the reionization model can be inferred with per-cent level precision with $\\sim 120$hrs of integration time using SKA-Low. Compared to model inference using only the power spectrum monopole above the foreground wedge, model inference using multipole power spectra in clustering wedges yields a factor of $\\sim 3$ improvement on the marginalised 1D parameter constraints.\n",

      "  - The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. In the densest YMCs, runaway stellar mergers can produce stars that collapse into IMBHs, with their final masses depending on the treatment of the giant star envelopes during collisions. If a common-envelope prescription is assumed, where the envelope is partially or entirely lost, stars form with masses up to $824\\,M_{\\odot}$, collapsing into IMBHs of $232\\,M_{\\odot}$. Alternatively, if no mass loss is assumed, stars as massive as $4000\\,M_{\\odot}$ can form, collapsing into IMBHs of $\\sim 4000\\,M_{\\odot}$. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\\sim$ 40%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.\n",

Moran's $I$ statistic is used to quantify the degree of kinematic substructure in each region, and the results are compared to those expected assuming the hierarchical or monolithic models of star cluster formation. Of the observed regions, 39 are found to have significant kinematic substructure, such that they are compatible with the hierarchical model and incompatible with the monolithic model. This includes multiple regions whose $Q$ parameter shows the region to be centrally concentrated and clustered. The remaining nine are compatible with both models. From this it is concluded that the kinematic substructure of the observed star clusters represents strong evidence in favour the hierarchical model of star cluster formation over the monolithic model.\n",

      "  - The largely unexplored decameter radio band (10-30 MHz) provides a unique window for studying a range of astronomical topics, such as auroral emission from exoplanets, inefficient cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms, fossil radio plasma, and free-free absorption. The scarcity of low-frequency studies is mainly due to the severe perturbing effects of the ionosphere. Here we present a calibration strategy that can correct for the ionosphere in the decameter band. We apply this to an observation from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) between 16 to 30 MHz . The resulting image covers 330 square degrees of sky at a resolution of 45\", reaching a sensitivity of 12 mJy/beam. Residual ionospheric effects cause additional blurring ranging between 60 to 100\". This represents an order of magnitude improvement in terms of sensitivity and resolution compared to previous decameter band observations. In the region we surveyed, we have identified four fossil plasma sources. These rare sources are believed to contain old, possibly re-energised, radio plasma originating from previous outbursts of active galactic nuclei. At least three of them are situated near the center of low-mass galaxy clusters. Notably, two of these sources display the steepest radio spectral index among all the sources detected at 23 MHz. This indicates that fossil plasma sources constitute the primary population of steep-spectrum sources at these frequencies, emphasising the large discovery potential of ground-based decameter observations.\n",

      "  - Many globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) have been studied in recent years, especially in hidden regions such as those of the Galactic bulge. Our main goal is to understand what we can learn if we include these new objects into the MWGC system that we know today. We catalogue 37 recently discovered GCs. We use different distributions for investigating the MWGC system: metallicity distribution (MD), luminosity function (LF), and age distribution. We first treat separately the new GCs sample from the known and well-characterised GCs. We merge these two samples, upgrading the MWGC system. We performed a comparison between our clusters sample and field star (FS) population. We find a double peaked distribution for the LF, which shows an elongated faint end tail. Considering the \"merged\" sample, the LF and the MDs display a bimodality trend. We construct the MD for the FS sample, and comparing this with that one of the GCs, we learn that a high percentage of FS show [Fe/H]$>0$, whereas we do not detect any GCs in the same metallicity range. In order to understand this inconsistency, we construct the age-metallicity diagram for both samples, noting that the old and metal-poor population (age$\\geq8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$\\leq -1.0$) is represented by GCs, while the young and metal-rich population (age$<8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$>-1.0$) corresponds to FS. From the analysis of the GC LF and MD, we can conclude that many GCs, probably those very faint, have survived strong dynamical processes, typical of the Bulge regions. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of them have been accreted during past merging events, especially the metal-poor component, whereas the metal-rich population may be related to the formation of the bulge and/or disk. Finally, the difference that we notice between the GC and FS samples should be sought in the evolutionary difference between these two stellar populations.\n",

      "  - In the context of the study of the size-age relationship observed in star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the investigation of its origin, here we present the determination of the structural parameters and the dynamical age of the massive cluster NGC 1835. We have used a powerful combination of optical and near-ultraviolet images acquired with the WFC3 onboard the HST to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, determining the values of the core, half-mass and tidal radii through the comparison with the King model family. The same data also allowed us to evaluate the dynamical age of the cluster by using the 'dynamical clock'. This is an empirical method that quantifies the level of central segregation of blue stragglers stars (BSSs) within the cluster half-mass radius by means of the A+ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. The results confirm that NGC 1835 is a very compact cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The estimated value of A+ ($0.30\\pm 0.04$) is the largest measured so far in the LMC clusters, providing evidence of a highly dynamically evolved stellar system. NGC 1835 nicely fits into the correlation between A+ and the central relaxation time and in the anti-correlation between A+ and the core radius defined by the Galactic and the Magellanic Cloud clusters investigated to date.\n",

Using $JHK$ data obtained from UKIDSS, the calculated disk fraction values for low-mass stars (0.2-2 M$_{\\odot}$) ranged from 42% to 7%. To enhance the statistical reliability of our analysis, eight additional low-metallicity clusters are sourced from previous studies with metallicity range 0.25-0.85 Z$_{\\odot}$ along with our sample, resulting in a total of 18 regions with low-metallicity. We find that low-metallicity clusters exhibit on average $2.6\\pm0.2$ times lower disk fraction compared to solar-metallicity clusters in all the age bins we have. Within the age range we can probe, our study does not find evidence of faster disk decay in sub-solar metallicity regions compared to solar-metallicity regions. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between cluster disk fraction and metallicity for two different age groups of 0.3-1.4 and 1.4-2.5 Myr.

It is an essential step to map between observables and their initial coordinates, called Lagrangian space, from which primordial perturbations transfer their information to structures via linear theory. By using numerical simulations and state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, we report the accuracy of estimating the Lagrangian coordinates of galaxies and galaxy clusters, represented by dark matter halos in various ranges of mass, and study the accuracy of this remapping on the angular momentum (spin) reconstruction. Our work shows that galaxy groups and clusters, represented by halos with mass $\\gtrsim 10^{13}M_\\odot$, can be accurately remapped to Lagrangian space, and their spin reconstruction errors are dominated by the reconstructed initial gravitational potential. For all mass ranges, the errors of Lagrangian remapping, as well as redshift space distortions, play subdominant roles in estimating their angular momenta.

Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that the progenitors of all ETGs were first rotating quickly, but then mergers decreased their rotational support. In the presented work, we studied this process using an observational archaeological approach. Namely, we inspected the correlations of 23 merger-sensitive characteristics of local ETGs with a parameter quantifying the rotational support. We used a volume-limited sample of local ETGs, that are not in galaxy clusters, from the MATLAS survey. We found, for example, that slowly rotating galaxies have tidal features and kinematically distinct components more often and have lower metallicities. We sought for mutual interpretation of the correlations among all 23 quantities, together with literature results on high-redshift massive galaxies. There seems to be only one interpretation possible: on average, ETGs lose their rotational support through multiple minor wet mergers happening at the redshifts above about two.\n",

      "  - The search for extraterrestrial intelligence includes efforts to constrain populations of artificial broadcasts in other galaxies. Previous efforts use individualist methods, searching for single broadcasts with high signal-to-noise ratio. These would be detected as observables with extreme values. This approach is limited to very bright broadcasts and also is subject to confusion, where a large number of broadcasts blend together to form a noise continuum. The mean value of the total emission provides an additional collective bound: the luminosity of the transmitters is no higher than the galaxy's observed luminosity. Using the framework developed in Paper I, I evaluate how confusion affects individualist searches. I then compare individualist and collective approaches for radio broadcasts from the Milky Way, M31, and three Virgo Cluster elliptical galaxies. For current observations, confusion blurs narrowband radio broadcasts together in the Virgo ellipticals when there is one broadcast per gigahertz per 1000 stars. The collective bound implies fewer than $\\sim 10^6 (\\overline{\\ell}/10^{13} W)^{-1}$ L-band broadcasts per star gigahertz GHz in the Milky Way and is about 10 and 400 times stronger in M31 and M59, respectively. Applying the collective bound to the far-infrared--radio correlation yields constraints on radio broadcast populations in star-forming galaxies throughout the Universe. The collective bound allows us to rule out large regions of broadcast population parameter space even for distant galaxies. It also imposes constraints on gamma-ray, neutrino, and gravitational-wave broadcasts in the nearest galaxies.\n",

We combine high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the F606W, F814W, and F160W pass-bands with spectroscopic observations taken as part of the KALEIDOSCOPE survey with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer mounted on the Very Large Telescope. Our strong lensing analysis of the mass distribution in the cluster core is constrained by four multiple-image systems (17 individual images) within redshift range $1.779<z<2.840$. Our weak-lensing analysis of the cluster outskirts, confined to the HST field of view, is based on a background galaxy catalogue with a density of 57 gal.arcmin$^{-2}$. We measure a projected mass of M($\\textrm{R}<200$ kpc) = (1.6 $\\pm$ 0.05) $\\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\\rm\\odot}$ from our strong-lensing model, and a projected mass of M($\\textrm{R}<640$ kpc) = (6.6 $\\pm$ 0.6) $\\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\\rm\\odot}$ when combining with our the weak-lensing constraints.

      "  - Near- to mid-Infrared observations (from Spitzer and JWST) have revealed a hidden population of galaxies at redshift z=3-6, called optically-dark objects, which are believed to be massive and dusty star-formers. While optically-dark sources are widely recognized as a significant component of the stellar mass function, the history of their stellar mass assembly remains unexplored. However, they are thought to be the progenitors of the more massive early-type galaxies found in present-day groups and clusters. It is thus important to examine the possible connection between dark sources and merging events, in order to understand the environment in which they live. Here, we report our search for close companions in a sample of 19 optically-dark objects identified in the SMACS0723 JWST deep field. They were selected in the NIRCam F444W band and undetected below 2mu. We restrict our analysis to the reddest (i.e. F277W-F444W> 1.3) and brightest (F444W< 26 mag) objects. We have identified an optically-dark source showing a very close companion (<0.5\"). The spatially resolved SED fitting procedure indicates that all components lying within 1.5\" from the dark source are indeed at z~5.7. Tidal features (leading to a whale shaped morphology) corroborate the hypothesis that the dark source is the most massive (log(M/Msun)>10.3) and dusty (Av~3 at the core) system of an ongoing merger with a mass ratio of ~10. Similar merging systems are identified in the SERRA simulations, allowing us to reconstruct their stellar mass assembly history and predict their molecular gas properties The discovery of mergers within dark galaxies at the end of the Epoch of Reionization underscores the importance of conducting a statistical search for additional candidates in deep NIRCam fields. Such research will aid in understanding the role of merging processes during the obscured phase of stellar mass accumulation.\n",

Here we report the discovery of intricate filamentary structure in and beyond the ~28' (570 kpc) long, helical radio tail of the Corkscrew Galaxy (1610-60.5, ESO137-G007), which resides in the X-ray bright cluster Abell 3627 (D = 70 Mpc). Deep radio continuum data were obtained with wide-field Phased Array Feeds on the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 944 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The Corkscrew Galaxy is located 15' north of the prominent wide-angle tail (WAT) radio galaxy 1610-60.8 (ESO137-G006) near the cluster centre. While the bright (young) part of its radio tail is highly collimated, the faint (old) part shows increasing oscillation amplitudes, break-ups, and filaments. We find a stunning set of arc-shaped radio filaments beyond and mostly orthogonal to the collimated Corkscrew tail end, forming a partial bubble. This may be the first detection of a \"proto-lobe\" seen in 3D MHD simulations by Nolting et al. (2019), formed by the face-on impact of the Corkscrew Galaxy with a shock front in the cluster outskirts. Interactions of the radio galaxy tail with the ICM are likely responsible for the tail collimation and shear forces within the ICM for its increasingly filamentary structure.

      "  - There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.\n",

To mitigate systematic errors, the DESI galaxy positions are employed to establish a reference frame and to correct the position-, magnitude-, and color-dependent discrepancies between SDSS and DESI imaging datasets. Spanning 12,589 square degrees, the catalog encompasses about 223.7 million non-Gaia objects down to $m_r \\sim$ 23. Based on 734k quasars, the assessment of the global systematic errors in the DESI-SDSS proper motion catalog yields values of 0.06 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\\mu_{\\alpha_{*}}$ and 0.12 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\\mu_{\\delta}$.

Further comparisons with proper motions from SDSS Stripe 82 reveal a strong consistency between the two datasets. As a practical application, we utilize fainter non-Gaia objects in our catalog to update the proper motions of 15 star clusters. The resulting proper motions for these clusters exhibit excellent consistency with those derived from Gaia data.

      "  - Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\\approx 60\\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.\n",

To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernovae route. Here we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of fourteen observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances, and will also be used to perform measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF).

      "  - Low-redshift probes, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae Ia luminosity distances, have been shown to be crucial for improving the bounds on the total neutrino mass from cosmological observations, due to their ability to break degeneracies among the different parameters. Here, we expand background observations to include $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, distance moduli from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters. For the very first time, we find neutrino mass limits below the minimal expectations from neutrino oscillation probes, suggesting non-standard neutrino and/or cosmological scenarios. The tightening of the neutrino mass bound is due to the slightly higher value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ preferred by the former three background probes, and also due to the improved errors on $H_0$ and the matter mass-energy density $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$. All values of $H_0$ are however in agreement at the $1-2\\sigma$ level. Interestingly, it is not only the combination of the three background probes that is responsible for the $\\sum m_\\nu <0.06$~eV limits, but also each of them independently.

      "  - Cluster-scale strong lensing is a powerful tool for exploring the properties of dark matter and constraining cosmological models. However, due to the complex parameter space, pixelized strong lens modeling in galaxy clusters is computationally expensive, leading to the point-source approximation of strongly lensed extended images, potentially introducing systematic biases. Herein, as the first paper of the ClUsteR strong Lens modelIng for the Next-Generation observations (CURLING) program, we use lensing ray-tracing simulations to quantify the biases and uncertainties arising from the point-like image approximation for JWST-like observations. Our results indicate that the approximation works well for reconstructing the total cluster mass distribution, but can bias the magnification measurements near critical curves and the constraints on the cosmological parameters, the total matter density of the Universe $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, and dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. To mitigate the biases, we propose incorporating the extended surface brightness distribution of lensed sources into the modeling. This approach reduces the bias in magnification from 46.2 per cent to 0.09 per cent for $\\mu \\sim 1000$. Furthermore, the median values of cosmological parameters align more closely with the fiducial model. In addition to the improved accuracy, we also demonstrate that the constraining power can be substantially enhanced. In conclusion, it is necessary to model cluster-scale strong lenses with pixelized multiple images, especially for estimating the intrinsic luminosity of highly magnified sources and accurate cosmography in the era of high-precision observations.\n",

The stellar populations to which they belong are indicated in their original studies: they are mostly bulge clusters, with some identified as disk or halo members.

Our findings are: (i) the VMPD shows lower Zn abundances than the rest, which indicates that it could be a relic of small stellar systems; (ii) Sequoia shows moderately high r-process abundances; (iii) Helmi streams show deficiencies in carbon and light neutron-capture elements; (iv) the fraction of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no enhancement in heavy elements (CEMP-no stars) seems low in the VMPD and the Helmi streams; and (v) a subgroup in GSE exhibits a very high fraction of r-process enhanced stars, with four out of five showing [Eu/Fe]> +1.0. The abundance patterns of other elements in VMP substructures largely match the whole VMP sample. We also study large-scale correlations between abundance ratios and kinematics without classifying stars into substructures, but it does not yield significant correlations once the overall chemical evolution is considered for most elements.\n",

      "  - The unprecedented precision in Gaia measurements of parallax allows us to capture a larger number of binary clusters. With the releases of Gaia data, the number of Galactic open clusters (OCs) increases with great rapidity, providing an excellent opportunity to confirm more binary clusters in the Milky Way. Using a recently released OC catalog, we employed the photometric and astrometric data of and OCs and their member stars to find close binary open clusters (CBOCs). The 3-dimensional spatial coordinates, proper motions, and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and a new CBOC identification technique are used for identifying CBOCs. We finally found 13 new pairs of CBOCs. The fundamental parameters of these CBOCs are determined by fitting the CMDs to the isochrones of stellar populations. When we check the similarity of reddenings, ages and metallicities of the sub-clusters of CBOCs, eight CBOCs are shown to be primordial binary open clusters (PBOCs). This paper reports the detailed data of the 13 newly found CBOCs, which will help us to do many further researches on binary star clusters.\n",

      "  - Bubbles driven by energy and mass injection from small scales are ubiquitous in astrophysical fluid systems and essential to feedback across multiple scales. In particular, O stars in young clusters produce high velocity winds that create hot bubbles in the surrounding gas. We demonstrate that the dynamical evolution of these bubbles is critically dependent upon the geometry of their interfaces with their surroundings and the nature of heat transport across these interfaces. These factors together determine the amount of energy that can be lost from the interior through cooling at the interface, which in turn determines the ability of the bubble to do work on its surroundings. We further demonstrate that the scales relevant to physical dissipation across this interface are extremely difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations of bubbles for parameter values of interest. This means the dissipation driving evolution of these bubbles in numerical simulations is often of a numerical nature. We describe the physical and numerical principles that determine the level of dissipation in these simulations; we use this, along with a fractal model for the geometry of the interfaces, to explain differences in convergence behavior between hydrodynamical and magneto-hydrodynamical simulations presented here. We additionally derive an expression for momentum as a function of bubble radius expected when the relevant dissipative scales are resolved and show that it still results in efficiently-cooled solutions as postulated in previous work.\n",

We test and benchmark some of these new techniques in a community data challenge \"Beyond-2pt\", initiated during the Aspen 2022 Summer Program \"Large-Scale Structure Cosmology beyond 2-Point Statistics,\" whose first round of results we present here. The challenge dataset consists of high-precision mock galaxy catalogs for clustering in real space, redshift space, and on a light cone. Participants in the challenge have developed end-to-end pipelines to analyze mock catalogs and extract unknown (\"masked\") cosmological parameters of the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM models with their methods. The methods represented are density-split clustering, nearest neighbor statistics, BACCO power spectrum emulator, void statistics, LEFTfield field-level inference using effective field theory (EFT), and joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using both EFT and simulation-based inference. In this work, we review the results of the challenge, focusing on problems solved, lessons learned, and future research needed to perfect the emerging beyond-2pt approaches. The unbiased parameter recovery demonstrated in this challenge by multiple statistics and the associated modeling and inference frameworks supports the credibility of cosmology constraints from these methods.

      "  - Globular cluster (GC) stars composed of pristine material (first-generation, 1G, stars) are not chemically homogeneous, as they exhibit extended sequences in the \"Chromosome Map\" (ChM). Recent studies characterized 1G stars within the center of 55 Galactic GCs, revealing metallicity variations. Despite this progress, several unanswered questions persist, particularly concerning the link between the 1G metallicity spread and factors such as the radial distance from the cluster center or the host GC parameters. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the extended 1G sequence phenomenon is exclusive to old Galactic GCs with multiple populations. This work addresses these open issues, examining 1G stars in different environments. First, we combine Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope photometry of the GC 47 Tucanae to study 1G stars at increasing distances from the cluster center. We find that metal-rich 1G stars are more centrally concentrated than metal-poor ones, suggesting a metallicity radial gradient. Additionally, the two groups of 1G stars share similar kinematics. Since our analysis focuses on giant stars in the cluster center and M dwarfs in external fields, we discuss the possibility that the metallicity distribution depends on stellar mass. Subsequently, we analyze HST multi-band photometry of two simple-population clusters, NGC 6791 and NGC 1783, revealing elongated sequences in the ChM associated with metallicity variations. Finally, we investigate the 1G color distribution in 51 GCs, finding no connections with the host cluster parameters. These results shed light on the complex nature of 1G stars, providing insights into the GC formation environment.\n",

      "  - Globular clusters contain vast repositories of metal-poor stars that represent some of the oldest stellar generations in the Universe. The archaeological footprint of early Galactic evolution may be retained in the measurable properties of globular clusters, such as their ages, mass functions and chemical abundances. Until recently, all photometric studies of globular clusters were restricted to stellar members. Now, the sensitivity of JWST can extend this analysis to the substellar regime. If detected in sufficient numbers, brown dwarf members can provide tight constraints on the properties of their parent population. We present SANDee - a new grid of stellar models that accurately represent the color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters across the hydrogen-burning limit at a wide range of metallicities. Using JWST NIRCam photometry and the new models, we identify three brown dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397 with effective temperatures of 1300-1800 K, confirmed by both proper motion and model fitting. We use the observed luminosities of discovered brown dwarfs to obtain the first age estimate of a globular cluster from its substellar cooling sequence: 13.4 +/- 3.3 Gyr. We also derive the local mass function of the cluster across the hydrogen-burning limit and find it to be top-heavy, suggesting extensive dynamical evolution. We expect that the constraints on both age and mass function of NGC 6397 derived in this work can be greatly improved by a second epoch of NIRCam imaging in the same field.\n",

We dealt with a heavy differential absorption across the observed field, a crowded field star population, and the superposition of field stars on to the cluster color-magnitude diagram main features to produce an intrinsic cluster stars density map. The resulting stellar density map reveals the presence of an extended envelope, a tidal tail, and scattered debris; the tidal tails pointing toward the Milky Way center. Such extra-tidal overdensities, detected above the mean star field density, resulted to be between four and six times larger that the local star field density fluctuation. They have also been recently generated by two independent studies which performed numerical simulations of synthetic tidal tails of Milky Way globular clusters.

Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\\sum m_\\nu < 0$ and find $\\sum m_\\nu = - 160 \\pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence.

We then show how a result of $\\sum m_\\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses.

      "  - The observed rest-UV luminosity function at cosmic dawn ($z \\sim 8-14$) measured by JWST revealed an excess of UV-luminous galaxies relative to many pre-launch theoretical predictions. A high star-formation efficiency (SFE) and a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) are among the mechanisms proposed for explaining this excess. Although a top-heavy IMF has been proposed for its ability to increase the light-to-mass ratio (\\(\\Psi_{\\mathrm{UV}}\\)), the resulting enhanced radiative pressure from young stars could decrease the star formation efficiency (SFE), potentially driving galaxy luminosities back down. In this Letter, we use idealized radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation to explore the effects of a top-heavy IMF on the SFE of clouds typical of the high pressure conditions found at these redshifts. We find that the SFE in star clusters with solar neighbourhood-like dust abundance decreases with increasingly top-heavy IMF's -- by $\\sim 20 \\%$ for an increase of factor 4 in $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{UV}}$, and by $50 \\%$ for a factor $ \\sim 10$ in $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{UV}}$. However, we find that an expected decrease in the dust-to-gas ratio ($\\sim 0.01 \\times \\mathrm{Solar}$) at these redshifts can completely compensate for the enhanced light output. This leads to a (cloud-scale; $\\sim 10 \\, \\mathrm{pc}$) SFE that is $\\gtrsim 70\\%$ even for a factor 10 increase in $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{UV}}$, implying that highly efficient star formation is unavoidable for high surface density and low metallicity conditions. Our results suggest that a top-heavy IMF, if present, likely coexists with efficient star formation in these galaxies.\n",

We present follow-up observations at 60 MHz to constrain the spectral index of the bridge, which so far has only been detected at 140 and 144 MHz. We analysed deep (~18 hours) LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Low Band Antenna (LBA) data at 60 MHz to detect the bridge at very low frequencies. We then conducted a multi-frequency study with LOFAR HBA data at 144 MHz and uGMRT data at 400 MHz. Assuming second-order Fermi mechanisms for the re-acceleration of relativistic electrons driven by turbulence in the radio bridge regions, we compare the observed radio spectrum with theoretical synchrotron models. The bridge is detected in the 75'' resolution LOFAR image at 60 MHz and its emission fully connects the region between the two galaxy clusters. Between 60 MHz and 144 MHz we found an integrated spectral index value of -1.44 +\\- 0.16 for the bridge emission. For the first time, we produced spectral index and related uncertainties maps for a radio bridge. We produce a radio spectrum, which show significant steepening between 144 and 400 MHz. This detection at low frequencies provides important information on the models of particle acceleration and magnetic field structure on very extended scales. The spectral index gives important clues to the origin of inter-cluster diffuse emission. The steepening of the spectrum above 144 MHz can be explained in a turbulent re-acceleration framework, assuming that the acceleration timescales are longer than ~200 Myr.\n",

      "  - A dark star cluster (DSC) is a system in which the cluster potential is dominated by stellar remnants, such as black holes and neutron stars having larger masses than the long-lived low-mass stars. Due to mass segregation, these remnants are located in the central region of the cluster and form a dark core. We expect that at a few kpc from the Galactic centre, the efficient evaporation of the lower-mass stars caused by the strong tidal force exposes the dark core, because the dynamical properties of the DSC are dominated by the remnants. Due to the invisibility of the remnants, finding a DSC by observation is challenging. In this project, we use $N$-body simulations to obtain models of DSCs and try to discern observables that signify a DSC. We consider four observables: the mass spectrum, the observational mass density profile, the observational velocity dispersion profile and the mass segregation. The models show that a DSC typically exhibits two distinct characteristics: for a given mass in stars and a given half-light radius the expected velocity dispersion is underestimated when only visible stars are considered, and there is a lack of measurable mass segregation among the stars. These properties can be helpful for finding DSCs in observational data, such as the Gaia catalogue.\n",

The DREAMS project will ultimately comprise thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously vary over dark matter physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in modeling a range of systems -- from galaxy clusters to ultra-faint satellites. Such extensive simulation suites can provide adequate training sets for machine-learning-based analyses. This paper introduces two new cosmological hydrodynamical suites of Warm Dark Matter, each comprised of 1024 simulations generated using the Arepo code. One suite consists of uniform-box simulations covering a $(25~h^{-1}~{\\rm M}_\\odot)^3$ volume, while the other consists of Milky Way zoom-ins with sufficient resolution to capture the properties of classical satellites. For each simulation, the Warm Dark Matter particle mass is varied along with the initial density field and several parameters controlling the strength of baryonic feedback within the IllustrisTNG model. We provide two examples, separately utilizing emulators and Convolutional Neural Networks, to demonstrate how such simulation suites can be used to disentangle the effects of dark matter and baryonic physics on galactic properties. The DREAMS project can be extended further to include different dark matter models, galaxy formation physics, and astrophysical targets.

      "  - Simulations and observations find long tails in jellyfish galaxies, which are commonly thought to originate from ram-pressure stripped gas of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the immediate galactic wake. While at larger distances from the galaxy, they have been claimed to form in situ owing to thermal instability and fast radiative cooling of mixed ISM and intracluster medium (ICM). In this paper, we use magneto-hydrodynamical windtunnel simulations of a galaxy with the arepo code to study the origin of gas in the tails of jellyfish galaxies. To this end, we model the galaxy orbit in a cluster by accounting for a time-varying galaxy velocity, ICM density and turbulent magnetic field. Tracking gas flows between the ISM, the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the ICM, we find contrary to popular opinion that the majority of gas in the tail originated in the CGM. Prior to the central passage of the jellyfish galaxy in the cluster, the CGM is directly transported to the clumpy jellyfish tail that has been shattered into small cloudlets. After the central cluster passage, gas in the tail originates both from the initial ISM and the CGM, but that from the latter was accreted to the galactic ISM before being ram-pressure stripped to form filamentary tentacles in the tail. Our simulation shows a declining gas metallicity in the tail as a function of downstream distance from the galaxy. We conclude that the CGM plays an important role in shaping the tails of jellyfish galaxies.\n",

We detect lines from CO isotopologues, HCN, H$_2$CO, and C$_2$H toward both protoplanetary disks. Based on the observed disk-integrated line fluxes and flux ratios, we do not find significant differences between isolated and irradiated disks. The observed differences seem to be more closely related to the different stellar masses than to the external radiation field. This suggests that these disks are far enough away from the massive Trapezium stars, that their chemistry is no longer affected by external FUV radiation. Additional observations towards lower-mass disks and disks closer to the massive Trapezium stars are required to elucidate the level of external radiation required to make an impact on the chemistry of planet formation in different kinds of disks.\n",

      "  - Large-scale sky surveys at low frequencies, like the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), allow for the detection and characterisation of unprecedented numbers of giant radio galaxies (GRGs, or 'giants'). In this work, by automating the creation of radio--optical catalogues, we aim to significantly expand the census of known giants. We then combine this sample with a forward model to constrain GRG properties of cosmological interest. In particular, we automate radio source component association through machine learning and optical host identification for resolved radio sources. We create a radio--optical catalogue for the full LoTSS Data Release 2 (DR2) and select all possible giants. We combine our candidates with an existing catalogue of LoTSS DR2 crowd-sourced GRG candidates and visually confirm or reject them. To infer intrinsic GRG properties from GRG observations, we develop further a population-based forward model that takes into account selection effects and constrain its parameters using Bayesian inference. We confirm 5,647 previously unknown giants from the crowd-sourced catalogue and 2,597 previously unknown giants from the ML-driven catalogue. Our confirmations and discoveries bring the total number of known giants to at least 11,585. We predict a comoving GRG number density $n_\\mathrm{GRG} = 13 \\pm 10\\ (100\\ \\mathrm{Mpc})^{-3}$, close to a recent estimate of the number density of luminous non-giant radio galaxies. We derive a current-day GRG lobe volume-filling fraction $V_\\mathrm{GRG-CW}(z = 0) = 1.4 \\pm 1.1 \\cdot 10^{-5}$ in clusters and filaments of the Cosmic Web. Our analysis suggests that giants are more common than previously thought. Moreover, tentative results imply that it is possible that magnetic fields once contained in giants pervade a significant ($\\gtrsim 10\\%$) fraction of today's Cosmic Web.\n",

      "  - Gravitational lensing is a crucial tool for exploring cosmic phenomena, providing insights into galaxy clustering, dark matter, and dark energy. Given the substantial computational demands of $N$-body simulations, approximate methods like $\\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\\texttt{turboGL}$ have been proposed as viable alternatives for simulating lensing probability density functions (PDFs). This paper evaluates these methods and their effectiveness across both weak and strong lensing regimes, with a focus in the context where baryonic effects are negligible. Our comparative analysis reveals that these methods are effective for applications where lensing is mild, such as the majority of sources of electromagnetic and gravitational waves. However, both $\\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ and $\\texttt{turboGL}$ break down for large values of convergence and magnification due to their loss of accuracy in capturing small-scale nonlinear matter fields, owing to oversimplified assumptions about internal halo structures and reliance on perturbation theory. $\\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ yields second-to-fourth moments of the lensing PDFs, which are 6-10% smaller than those resulting from $N$-body simulations in regimes where baryonic effects are minimal. These findings aim to inform future studies on gravitational lensing of point sources, which are increasingly relevant with upcoming supernova and gravitational wave datasets.\n",

      "  - Terrestrial particle accelerators collide charged particles, then watch the trajectory of outgoing debris - but they cannot manipulate dark matter. Fortunately, dark matter is the main component of galaxy clusters, which are continuously pulled together by gravity. We show that galaxy cluster mergers can be exploited as enormous, natural dark matter colliders. We analyse hydrodynamical simulations of a universe containing self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which all particles interact via gravity, and dark matter particles can also scatter off each other via a massive mediator. During cluster collisions, SIDM spreads out and lags behind cluster member galaxies. Individual systems can have quirky dynamics that makes them difficult to interpret. Statistically, however, we find that the mean or median of dark matter's spatial offset in many collisions can be robustly modelled, and is independent of our viewing angle and halo mass even in collisions between unequal-mass systems. If the SIDM cross-section were sigma/m = 0.1cm^2/g = 0.18 barn/GeV, the 'bulleticity' lag would be ~5 percent that of gas due to ram pressure, and could be detected at 95 percent confidence in weak lensing observations of ~100 well-chosen clusters.\n",

However, the absence of a clear merging companion identified to date hampers our understanding of the evolutionary track of the Perseus cluster consistent with these observational features. In this paper, through careful weak lensing analysis, we successfully identified the missing subcluster halo ($M_{200}=1.70^{+0.73}_{-0.59}\\times10^{14}~M_{\\odot}$) at the >5$\\sigma$ level centered on NGC1264, which is located ~430 kpc west of the Perseus main cluster core. Moreover, a significant ($>3\\sigma$) mass bridge, which is also traced by the cluster member galaxies, is detected between the Perseus main and sub clusters, which serves as direct evidence of gravitational interaction. With idealized numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a ~3:1 off-axis major merger can create the cold front observed ~700 kpc east of the main cluster core and also generate the observed mass bridge through multiple core crossings. This discovery resolves the long-standing puzzle of Perseus' dynamical state.\n",

Open clusters provide valuable information on stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their age and distances can be measured more precisely with photometry than for field stars. Aims. Our aim is to study the chemical distribution of the Galactic disc using open clusters by analysing the existence of gradients with Galactocentric distance, azimuth or height from the plane and dependency with age. Methods. High-resolution spectra (R>60 000) of 194 stars belonging to 36 open clusters are used to determine atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances with two independent methods: equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. The sample has been complemented with 63 clusters with high-resolution spectroscopy from literature. Results. We measure local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for 21 elements: {\\alpha} (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), odd-Z (Na and Al), Fe-peak (Fe, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn), and neutron-capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, and Nd). We also provide non-local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for elements when corrections are available. We find inner disc young clusters enhanced in [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] compared to other clusters of their age. For [Ba/Fe] we report an age trend flattening for older clusters (age<2.5 Ga). The studied elements follow the expected radial gradients as a function of their nucleosynthesis groups, which are significantly steeper for the oldest systems. For the first time, we investigate the existence of an azimuthal gradient, finding some hints of its existence among the old clusters (age>2 Ga).\n",

      "  - Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.\n",

This study confirms a pair of X-ray cavities at projected distances of about 10.30 kpc and 20.80 kpc, respectively, on the NW and SE of the X-ray peak. GMRT L band (1.4 GHz) data revealed a bright radio source associated with the core of this cluster hosting multiple jet-like emissions. The spatial association of the X-ray cavities with the inner pair of radio jets confirm their origin due to AGN outbursts. The 1.4 GHz radio power ${\\rm 7.4 \\pm 0.8 \\times 10^{39} \\, erg\\, s^{-1}}$ is correlated with the mechanical power stored in the X-ray cavities ($\\sim7.90\\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), implying that the power injected by radio jets in the ICM is sufficient enough to offset the radiative losses.

In this work, we extend our previous study and apply the <SFR5>/<SFR200> metric to a sample of eleven nearby galaxies with MUSE observations. Based on a combination of H$\\alpha$ and UV photometry, <SFR5>/<SFR200> is sensitive to star formation timescales of ~5-200 Myr and therefore measures the present-day rate of change in the star formation rate, dSFR/dt. Within this limited galaxy sample, we do not observe systematic variations between the global value of <SFR5>/<SFR200> and the presence of an active galactic nucleus, stellar bar, nor with group or cluster membership. Within some of the individual galaxies, we however observe significant differences in <SFR5>/<SFR200> between the arm and interarm regions. In half of the galaxies, the recent SFH of both arm and interarm regions has been very similar. However, in the galaxies with higher bulge-to-total light ratios and earlier morphological type, the SFR is declining more rapidly in the interarm regions. This decline in SFR is not a result of low molecular gas surface density or a decrease in the star formation efficiency, implying that other factors are responsible for this SFR decrease.\n",

      "  - Traditional studies on stellar streams typically involve phenomenological $\\Lambda$CDM halos or ad hoc dark matter (DM) profiles with different degrees of triaxiality, which preclude to gain insights into the nature and mass of the DM particles. Recently, a Maximum Entropy Principle of halo formation has been applied to provide a DM halo model which incorporates the fermionic (quantum) nature of the particles, while leading to DM profiles which depend on the fermion mass. Such profiles develop a more general dense core - diluted halo morphology able to explain the Galactic rotation curve, while the degenerate fermion core can mimic the central massive black hole (BH). We attempt to model the GD-1 stellar stream using a spherical core-halo DM distribution for the host, which, at the same time, explains the dynamics of the S-cluster stars through its degenerate fermion-core with no central BH. We used two optimization algorithms in order to fit both the initial conditions of the stream orbit and the fermionic model. The stream observables are 5D phase-space data from the Gaia DR2 survey. We were able to find good fits for both the GD-1 stream and the S-stars for a family of fermionic core-halo profiles parameterized by the fermion mass. This work provides evidence that the fermionic profile is a reliable model for both the massive central object and the DM of the Galaxy. Remarkably, this model predicts a total MW mass of $2.3\\times 10^{11}M_{\\odot}$ which is in agreement with recent mass estimates obtained from Gaia DR3 rotation curves (Gaia RC). In summary, with one single fermionic model for the DM distribution of the MW, we obtain a good fit in three totally different distance scales of the Galaxy: $\\sim 10^{-6}$ kpc (central, S-stars), $\\sim14$ kpc (mid, GD-1) and $\\sim 30$ kpc (boundary, Gaia RC mass estimate).\n",

      "  - We use analytical and $N$-body methods to study the capture of field stars by gravitating substructures moving across a galactic environment. The majority of stars captured by a substructure move on temporarily-bound orbits that are lost to galactic tides after a few orbital revolutions. In numerical experiments where a substructure model is immersed into a sea of field particles on a circular orbit, we find a population of particles that remain bound to the substructure potential for indefinitely-long times. This population is absent from substructure models initially placed outside the galaxy on an eccentric orbit. We show that gravitational capture is most efficient in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) on account of their low velocity dispersions and high stellar phase-space densities. In these galaxies `dark' sub-subhaloes which do not experience in-situ star formation may capture field stars and become visible as stellar overdensities with unusual properties: (i) they would have a large size for their luminosity, (ii) contain stellar populations indistinguishable from the host galaxy, and (iii) exhibit dark matter (DM)-dominated mass-to-light ratios. We discuss the nature of several `anomalous' stellar systems reported as star clusters in the Fornax and Eridanus II dSphs which exhibit some of these characteristics. DM sub-subhaloes with a mass function $d N/d M_\\bullet\\sim M_\\bullet^{-\\alpha}$ are expected to generate stellar systems with a luminosity function, $d N/d M_\\star\\sim M_\\star^{-\\beta}$, where $\\beta=(2\\alpha+1)/3=1.6$ for $\\alpha=1.9$.

      "  - The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs) -- a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies -- is one of the most surprising results from JWST. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: does the near-infrared emission originate from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), or intense star formation? In this work, we utilize ultra-deep Chandra observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, Abell~2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of $\\lesssim(1.5-16)\\times10^{6}~\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of $\\approx87$~Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H$\\alpha$ emission. For the LRDs exhibiting broad-line H$\\alpha$ emission, there is a hint of a stacked signal ($\\sim2.6\\sigma$), corresponding to a SMBH mass of $\\sim3.2\\times10^{6}~\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$. Assuming unobscured, Eddington-limited accretion, this BH mass is at least 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from virial mass estimates using JWST spectra. Given galaxy-dominated stellar mass estimates, our results imply that LRDs do not host over-massive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. However, alternative stellar mass estimates may still support that LRDs host over-massive BHs. The significant discrepancy between the JWST and Chandra data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H$\\alpha$ line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.\n",

Here, we focus on the study of stellar feedback in isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, by performing numerical simulations using a modified version of the SPH code GADGET-3. The Milky Way satellite Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group was considered as our default model dwarf galaxy. The parameter space for the stellar feedback models was explored to match observational constraints of Leo II, such as residual gas mass, total mass within the tidal radius, star formation history, final stellar mass, stellar ages and metallicity. Additionally, we examined the impact of the binary fraction of stars, initial mass function, dark matter halo mass and initial gas reservoir. Many simulations revealed recent star formation quenching due to stellar feedback. In general, the gas depletion, expected star formation history, total mass of stars and total mass within the tidal radius were adequately reproduced in the simulations when compared to observational estimates. However, there were discrepancies in the distribution of stellar ages and metallicities, which suggested that the cosmic gas infall would play a more complex role in our dwarf spheroidal galaxy than captured by a monolithic infall scenario.

The dependency of model parameters on the age, coverage, and strength of the clusters are also presented. This is the first comprehensive 2D kinematic study using star clusters. Red clump (RC) stars and young main-sequence stars are also modeled for comparison.

We also note a significant radial variation of the disk parameters. Clusters and young stars are found to have a large residual proper motion and a relatively large velocity dispersion when compared to the RC field population, which could be due to perturbation from the bar and spiral arms. We traced the presence of large residual proper motion and non-circular motion among clusters likely to be due to the bar and detected a decrease in the scale radius as a result of the possible evolution of the bar.

Besides, both populations have consistent distribution of ellipticity (median $\\epsilon\\sim$ 0.3), half-light radius (median $r_{\\rm eff} \\sim$ 4$^{\\prime\\prime}$), and Sersic index (median $n$ = 1), implying the dominance of the full sample by the round and disk galaxies.

      "  - $ $Low density cosmic voids gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB), leaving a negative imprint on the CMB convergence $\\kappa$. This effect provides insight into the distribution of matter within voids, and can also be used to study the growth of structure. We measure this lensing imprint by cross-correlating the Planck CMB lensing convergence map with voids identified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data set, covering approximately 4,200 deg$^2$ of the sky. We use two distinct void-finding algorithms: a 2D void-finder which operates on the projected galaxy density field in thin redshift shells, and a new code, Voxel, which operates on the full 3D map of galaxy positions. We employ an optimal matched filtering method for cross-correlation, using the MICE N-body simulation both to establish the template for the matched filter and to calibrate detection significances. Using the DES Y3 photometric luminous red galaxy sample, we measure $A_\\kappa$, the amplitude of the observed lensing signal relative to the simulation template, obtaining $A_\\kappa = 1.03 \\pm 0.22$ ($4.6\\sigma$ significance) for Voxel and $A_\\kappa = 1.02 \\pm 0.17$ ($5.9\\sigma$ significance) for 2D voids, both consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM expectations. We additionally invert the 2D void-finding process to identify superclusters in the projected density field, for which we measure $A_\\kappa = 0.87 \\pm 0.15$ ($5.9\\sigma$ significance). The leading source of noise in our measurements is Planck noise, implying that future data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT) and CMB-S4 will increase sensitivity and allow for more precise measurements.\n",

      "  - [Abridged] The gas distribution in galaxies is smooth on large scales, but is usually time-dependent and inhomogeneous on smaller scales. The time-dependence originates from processes such as cloud formation, their collisions, and supernovae (SNe) explosions, which also create inhomogeneities. The inhomogeneities in the matter distribution give rise to variations in the local galactic gravitational potential, which can contribute to dynamically coupling the gas disc to the stellar and the dark matter (DM) components of the galaxy. Specifically, multiple SNe occurring in young stellar clusters give rise to superbubbles (SBs), which modify the local acceleration field and alter the energy and momentum of stars or DM particles traversing them, in broad analogy to the dynamical friction caused by a massive object. Our aim is to quantify how the acceleration field from SBs causes dynamical friction and contributes to the secular evolution of galaxies. In order to assess this, we constructed the time-dependent density modifications to the gas distribution that mimics a SB. By evaluating the acceleration field from these density modifications, we were able to see how the momentum or angular momentum of the gas hosting the SBs changes when stars pass through the SB. Combining the effects of all the stars and SBs, we constructed an empirical approximation formula for the momentum loss in homogeneous and isotropic cases. We find that the rate at which the gas disc loses its specific angular momentum via the above process is up to 4% per Gyr, which translates to under one-half of its original value over the lifetime of the disc. For comparison, the mass transfer rate from SBs is about one order of magnitude less than from gas turbulence, and hence the SB contribution should be included to account for the gas migration rate more accurately than 10%.\n",

      "  - Giant radio galaxies (GRGs, giant RGs, or giants) are megaparsec-scale, jet-driven outflows from accretion disks of supermassive black holes, and represent the most extreme pathway by which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. A long-standing but unresolved question is why giants are so much larger than other radio galaxies. It has been proposed that, in addition to having higher jet powers than most RGs, giants might live in especially low-density Cosmic Web environments. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis by pinpointing Local Universe giants and other RGs in physically principled, Bayesian large-scale structure reconstructions. More specifically, we localised a LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2-dominated sample of luminous ($l_\\nu(\\nu = 150\\ \\mathrm{MHz}) \\geq 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{W\\ Hz^{-1}}$) giants and a control sample of LoTSS DR1 RGs, both with spectroscopic redshifts up to $z_\\mathrm{max} = 0.16$, in the BORG SDSS Cosmic Web reconstructions. We measured the Cosmic Web density for each RG; for the control sample, we then quantified the relation between RG radio luminosity and Cosmic Web density. With the BORG SDSS tidal tensor, we also measured for each RG whether the gravitational dynamics of its Cosmic Web environment resemble those of clusters, filaments, sheets, or voids. Luminous giants populate large-scale environments that tend to be denser than those of general RGs. This shows that -- at least at high jet powers -- low-density environments are no prerequisite for giant growth. This result is corroborated by gravitational dynamics classification and a cluster catalogue crossmatching analysis. This work presents more than a thousand inferred megaparsec-scale densities around radio galaxies. Our findings are consistent with the view that giants are regular, rather than mechanistically special, members of the radio galaxy population.\n",

Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use the MIST stellar models and our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $5.6 \\times 10^8$ binaries exploring 20 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\\odot$) and a low mass companion ($<1$ M$_\\odot$) in a wide ($P>10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e>0.6$). Such progenitor binary stars do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\\lesssim$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t>10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z<0.01$) populations to be $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{-8}$ M$_\\odot^{-1}$ (for our fiducial model), representing $\\sim 3\\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\\approx 4000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\\approx 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3-like. Given the density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one at the observed distance of Gaia BH3.

      "  - It is well established that black holes reside in the central regions of virtually all types of known galaxies. Recent observational and numerical studies however challenge this picture, suggesting that intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies may be found on orbits far from the center. In particular, constant-density cores minimize orbital energy losses due to dynamical friction, and allow black holes to settle on stable off-center orbits. Using controlled simulations, we study the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies with such cores. We propose a new scenario to describe off-center mergers of massive black holes, starting with a Jacobi capture. We focus on initially circular and co-planar black hole orbits and explore a large parameter space of black hole masses and orbital parameters. We find that Jacobi captures are a complex and chaotic phenomenon that occurs in about 13% of cases in this simplified setup, and we quantify how the likelihood of capture depends on the simulation parameters. We note that this percentage is likely an upper limit of the general case. Nevertheless, we show that Jacobi captures in cored dwarf galaxies can facilitate the formation of off-center black hole binaries, and that this process is sufficiently common to have a substantial effect on black hole growth. While our setup only allows for temporary captures, we expect dissipative forces from baryons and post-Newtonian corrections to maintain the captures over time and to lead to the formation of stable binary systems. This motivates future studies of the effectiveness of such dissipative forces, within stripped nuclei or globular clusters, in forming stable bound systems.\n",

Leveraging the largest-ever X-ray galaxy cluster and supercluster samples obtained from the first SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey, we construct two subsamples of galaxy clusters which consist of supercluster members (SC) and isolated clusters (ISO) respectively. After correcting the selection effects on redshift, mass, and survey depth, we compute the excess in the concentration of the intracluster gas of isolated clusters with respect to supercluster members, defined as $\\delta c_{\\rm gas} \\equiv c_{\\rm gas,ISO}/c_{\\rm gas,SC}-1$, to investigate the environmental effect on the concentration of clusters, an inference of halo assembly bias on cluster scales. We find that the average gas mass concentration of isolated clusters is a few percent higher than that of supercluster members, with a maximum significance of $2.8\\sigma$. The result on $\\delta c_{\\rm gas}$ varies with the overdensity ratio $f$ in supercluster identification, cluster mass proxies, and mass ranges, but remains positive in all the measurements. We measure slightly larger $\\delta c_{\\rm gas}$ when adopting a higher $f$ in supercluster identification. $\\delta c_{\\rm gas}$ is also larger for low-mass and low-redshift clusters. We perform weak lensing analyses to compare the total mass concentration of the two classes and find a similar trend as obtained from gas mass concentration. Our results are consistent with the prediction of HAB on cluster scales, where halos located in denser environments are less concentrated, and this trend is stronger for halos with lower mass and at lower redshifts. These phenomena can be interpreted by the fact that clusters in denser environments such as superclusters have experienced more mergers than isolated clusters in their assembling history.\n",

The statistically significant discrepancies between the locally measured values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ and the ones inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background assuming the canonical $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model have become a new cornerstone of theoretical physics. $\\Lambda_s$CDM is one of the many beyond Standard Model setups that have been proposed to simultaneously resolve the cosmological tensions.

      "  - Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter substructures on smaller scales. Deep high resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art {\\Lambda}CDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order of magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the {\\Lambda}CDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous {\\Lambda}CDM-motivated Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative dark matter models.\n",

In this paper, we use the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation to study the HI distribution in seven halos with masses similar to the Fornax galaxy cluster. Adopting observational sensitivities similar to the MeerKAT Fornax Survey (MFS), an ongoing HI survey that will probe to column densities of $10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, we find that Fornax-like TNG50 halos have an extended distribution of neutral hydrogen clouds. Within one virial radius, we predict the MFS will observe a total HI covering fraction around $\\sim$ 12\\% (mean value) for 10 kpc pixels and 6\\% for 2 kpc pixels.

Massive and luminous, they probably control and regulate the galaxies star formation rates. For this work I performed a redetermination of the spectral types and effective temperatures of the Galactic O-type stars MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273. From a careful examination of the spectral features present in the blue optical spectral region, it was possible to identify several nitrogen lines usually only seen in the blue optical spectra of O2-O3 stars. From the nitrogen ionic equivalent width ratios measured in the spectra of MSP182, MSP183, MSP199, VPHAS-01338, and VPHAS-01273, and in those of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, earlier spectral types and hotter effective temperature values were derived. Two O2V, together with three new O3V stars, are now firmly identified in the Westerlund 2 region. Besides RFS1 in NGC3603, the O2 stars found in Westerlund 2 are the only other exemplars known to date in the Milky Way. From the nitrogen equivalent width line ratios measured in the spectra of standard stars of the O2-O4 spectral types, linear relations between the NIV4058-NIII4640 ratio and the effective temperature in the 47000K-51000K range were derived. Based on my spectroscopic analysis of the science targets and the use of a HRD, a mean heliocentric distance of 5kpc to Westerlund 2 was computed, a result that is in line with the mean heliocentric distance of 5.3(1.5) kpc obtained from the associated Gaia DR3 parallaxes and distances. The Westerlund 2 massive stars studied in this work probably share a common evolutionary process that might be representative of the evolutionary ages of a large fraction of the cluster's O-type stellar population, which seems to be much younger than 1 Myrs.\n",

Objects accreted in groups are expected to share similar specific total energy and angular momentum, and also identical orbital planes and directions. Aims. Looking at observations of Milky Way satellites, the dwarf galaxies Leo II, IV, V, Crater II, and the star cluster Crater 1 were proposed to be a vestige of group infall. The suggested \"Crater-Leo group\" shows a coherent distance gradient and all these objects align along a great circle on the sky. We use proper motion data to investigate whether the phase-space distribution of the members of the proposed group are indeed consistent with group infall. Methods. To further investigate this possibility, we use Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proper motions, $(\\mu_{\\alpha*}, \\mu_\\delta) = (-0.1921 \\pm 0.0514, -0.0686 \\pm 0.0523)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo IV and $(\\mu_{\\alpha*}, \\mu_\\delta) = (0.1186 \\pm 0.1943, -0.1183 \\pm 0.1704)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Leo V, to derive accurate orbital properties for the proposed group objects. In addition, we explore other possible members of this putative association. Results. Leo II, Leo IV, and Crater 1 show orbital properties consistent with those we predict from assuming group infall. However, our results suggest that Crater II was not accreted with the rest of the objects. If confirmed with increasingly accurate proper motions in the future, the Crater-Leo objects appear to constitute the first identified case of a cosmologically expected, typical group infall event, as opposed to the highly hierarchical Magellanic Cloud system.\n",

This constraining power is on par with that of convolutional neural networks, suggesting that further investment in spatial information extraction may not yield substantial benefits.   We also point out an internal tension of $S_8$ estimates linked to a redshift bin around z ~ 1 in the HSC data. We found that discarding that bin leads to a consistent decrease of $S_8$ from 0.83 to 0.79, for all statistical estimators. We argue that photometric redshift estimation is now the main limitation in the estimation of $S_8$ using HSC. This limitation is likely to affect other ground-based weak lensing surveys reaching redshifts greater than one. Alternative redshift estimation techniques, like clustering redshifts, may help alleviate this limitation.\n",

      "  - We present spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy (UMG) with $\\log(M_\\star/M_\\odot) = 10.98 \\pm 0.07$ at $z_\\mathrm{spec} = 4.8947$ in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS), based on deep observations of Ly$\\alpha$ emission with Keck/DEIMOS. The ultra-massive galaxy (UMG-28740) is the most massive member in one of the most significant overdensities in the EGS, with four additional photometric members with $\\log(M_\\star/M_\\odot) > 10.5$ within $R_\\mathrm{proj} \\sim 1$ cMpc. The Ly$\\alpha$ profile is highly asymmetric ($A_f = 3.56$), suggesting the presence of neutral gas within the interstellar medium, circumgalactic medium, or via AGN-driven outflows. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using a large suite of star formation histories and two sets of high-quality photometry from ground- and space-based facilities consistently estimates the stellar mass of UMG-28740 to be $\\log(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\sim 11$ with a small standard deviation between measurements ($\\sigma = 0.07$). While the best-fit SED models agree on stellar mass, we find discrepancies in the estimated star formation rate for UMG-28740, resulting in either a star-forming or quiescent system. JWST/NIRCam photometry of UMG-28740 strongly favors a quiescent scenario, demonstrating the need for high-quality mid-IR observations. Assuming the galaxy to be quiescent, UMG-28740 formed the bulk of its stars at $z > 10$ and is quenching at $z \\sim 8$, resulting in a high star formation efficiency at high redshift ($\\epsilon \\sim 0.2$ at $z \\sim 5$ and $\\epsilon \\gtrsim 1$ at $z \\gtrsim 8$). As the most massive galaxy in its protocluster environment, UMG-28740 is a unique example of the impossibly early galaxy problem.\n",

      "  - We present follow-up spectroscopy on a protocluster candidate selected from the wide-field imaging of the Hyper SuprimeCam Subaru Strategic Programme. The target protocluster candidate was identified as a $4.5\\sigma$ overdense region of $g$-dropout galaxies, and the redshifts of $g$-dropout galaxies are determined by detecting their Ly$\\alpha$ emission. Thirteen galaxies, at least, are found to be clustering in the narrow redshift range of $\\Delta z<0.05$ at $z=3.699$. This is clear evidence of the presence of a protocluster in the target region. Following the discovery of the protocluster at $z=3.699$, the physical properties and three-dimensional distribution of its member galaxies are investigated. Based on spectroscopically-confirmed $g$-dropout galaxies, we find an overabundance of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) bright galaxies in the protocluster. The UV brightest protocluster member turns out to be an active galactic nucleus, and the other UV brighter members tend to show smaller Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths than field counterparts. The member galaxies tend to densely populate near the centre of the protocluster, but the separation from the nearest neighbour rather than the distance from the centre of the protocluster is more tightly correlated to galaxy properties, implying that the protocluster is still in an early phase of cluster formation and only close neighbours have a significant impact on the physical properties of protocluster members. The number density of massive galaxies, selected from an archival photometric-redshift catalogue, is higher near the centre of the protocluster, while dusty starburst galaxies are distributed on the outskirts. These observational results suggest that the protocluster consists of multiple galaxy populations, whose spatial distributions may hint at the developmental phase of the galaxy cluster.\n",

      "  - We present a detailed study of three-dimensional (3D) thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium (ICM) across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of four massive, bright, dynamically-active galaxy clusters (A3667, A2319, A520, and A2146), with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Based on a forward modeling approach developed in previous work, we extend this approach with more generalized ICM density and temperature profiles, allowing us to apply uniformly to the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles to detect edges and measure the 3D thermodynamic profiles of the ICM simultaneously and self-consistently. With the forward modeling analysis, we find, in agreement with previous works, that the obtained 3D thermodynamic structures of the ICM across the edges in A3667 and A2319 are consistent with the characteristics of cold fronts, whereas those in A520 and A2146 are consistent with the nature of shock fronts. We find that the azimuthal distribution of the pressure ratio at the cold front in A3667 shows a different trend from that in A2319. For the shock fronts in A520 and A2146, the observed 3D temperature profiles of the ICM indicate that the temperature is highest at the position of the shock front. In the case of the sector exhibiting M = 2.4 in A520, the ICM temperature appears isothermal with a temperature of ~10 keV until ~300 kpc away from the shock front in the post-shock region, being consistent with the hypothesis of the instant-equilibration model for shock-heating.\n",

      "  - The collective properties of star clusters are investigated using a simulation of the collision between two dwarf galaxies. The characteristic power law of the cluster mass function, N(M), with a logarithmic slope d\\log N/d\\log M ~ -1, is present from cluster birth and remains throughout the simulation. The maximum mass of a young cluster scales with the star formation rate (SFR). The relative average minimum separation, R(M)= N(M)^{1/p}D_min(M)/D(M_low), for average minimum distance D_min(M) between clusters of mass M, and for lowest mass, M_low, measured in projection (p=2) or three dimensions (p=3), has a negative slope, d log R/d log M ~ -0.2, for all masses and ages. This agrees with observations of R(M) in low-mass galaxies studied previously. Like the slope of N(M), R(M) is apparently a property of cluster birth for dwarf galaxies that does not depend on SFR or time. The negative slope for R(M) implies that massive clusters are more concentrated relative to lower mass clusters throughout the entire mass range. Cluster growth through coalescence is also investigated. The ratio of the kinetic to potential energy of all near-neighbor clusters is generally large, but a tail of low values in the distribution of this ratio suggests that a fraction of the clusters merge, ~8% by number throughout the ~300 Myr of the simulation and up to 60% by mass for young clusters in their first 10 Myr, scaling with the SFR above a certain threshold.\n",

      "  - Galaxies undergo processes throughout their lifetimes that ultimately lead to the expulsion of the gas and the cessation of the star-forming activity. This phenomenon commonly known as quenching, can be caused by environmental processes. For this we use the results of Romero-G\\'omez et al. (2024), who analyzed galaxies from the SAMI-Fornax and ATLAS$^{3D}$ survey. Using t$_{90}$ as an approximation for the quenching time and comparing it with the infall time derived from phase-space models, we determine the probability of the quenching being produced by the local environment of galaxies. Our results reveal a relation between galaxy mass and quenching probability. Down to M$_{\\star}$ $\\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, galaxies exhibit almost zero probability of quenching, suggesting their independence from environmental effects. As we move into the mass regime of dwarf galaxies, the probability increases with decreasing mass, highlighting their sensitivity to environmental quenching. For the dwarfs, 10$^{7}$ - 10$^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, 36$\\pm$9% of our observational data are consistent with this hypothesis, challenging the idea that the present-day cluster, Fornax, is the primary driver of quenching in the low mass galaxies. We compare these results with cosmological simulations, selecting galaxies under similar conditions to our observational sample. The simulated sample shows lower quenching probabilities as we move down in mass, only 5$\\pm$1% of galaxies meet the quenching criteria. This discrepancy between observations and simulations underlines that modelling quenching is still in its infancy. In general, the number of observed galaxies quenched by their environment is lower than expected, which suggests that pre-processing plays a larger role in galaxy evolution. Ultimately, our results highlight the need for higher-quality simulations and refinement of galaxy formation and evolution models.\n",

      "  - Most Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) harbour multiple populations of stars (MPs), composed of at least two generations: the first characterized by a \"standard\" $\\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture, as observed in field halo stars of the Milky Way, and the second displaying anti-correlated CN--ONa chemical abundance pattern in combination with an enhanced helium fraction. Adequate collections of stellar spectra are needed to characterize the effect of such stellar abundance changes on the integrated light of GCs. We present a grid of synthetic stellar spectra covering the atmospheric parameters relevant to old stellar populations at four subsolar metallicities and two abundance patterns, representative of first- and second-generations of stars in GCs. Integrated spectra of populations were computed using our stellar grid and empirical stellar populations, namely, colour-magnitude diagrams from literature for Galactic GCs. The spectra range from 290 to 1000nm, where we measured the effect on several spectrophotometric indices due to the surface abundance variations attributed to MPs. We find non-negligible effects of the MPs on spectroscopic indices sensitive to C, N, Ca, or Na, and on Balmer indices; we also describe how MPs modify specific regions in the near-UV and near-IR that can be measured with narrow or medium photometric passbands. The effects vary with metallicity. A number of these changes remain detectable even when accounting for the stochastic fluctuations due to the finite nature of the stellar population cluster.\n",

      "  - In this work, we address the following question: ``can we use the current cosmological simulations to identify intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and quantify a putative population of wandering IMBHs?''. We compare wandering-IMBH counts in different simulations with different sub-grid methods and post-processing recipes, the ultimate goal being to aid future wandering-IMBH detection efforts. In particular, we examine simulations in which IMBHs are identified as BH seeds forming at high redshift and those in which they are identified using star clusters as proxies, which implicitly appeals to a stellar dynamical formation channel. In addition, we employ the extremely high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical ``zoom-in'' simulation GigaEris with the star cluster proxies method to identify IMBHs. We find consistent counts of wandering high-redshift IMBHs across most of the different cosmological simulations employed so far in the literature, despite the different identification approaches, resulting in 5 to 18 wandering IMBHs per Milky Way-sized galaxy at $z \\geq 3$. Nevertheless, we argue this is only coincidental, as a significant discrepancy arises when examining the formation sites and the mass ranges of the wandering IMBHs. Furthermore, we cannot determine how many of the IMBHs identified at high redshift in GigaEris will be wandering IMBHs at $z = 0$ as opposed to how many will accrete to the central supermassive BH, promoting its growth. All of this casts doubts on the ability of current cosmological simulations to inform observational searches for wandering IMBHs.\n",

On the other hand, there is no significant evidence for an excess of extraplanar X-ray sources in a comparison sample of field late-type edge-on galaxies, for which Chandra observations reaching a similar source detection sensitivity are available. We discuss possible origins for the observed excess, which include low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with globular clusters, supernova-kicked LMXBs, high-mass X-ray binaries born in recent star formation induced by ram pressure stripping of the disk gas, as well as a class of intra-cluster X-ray sources previously identified around early-type member galaxies of Virgo.

      "  - The Spitzer instability leads to the formation of a black hole sub-system (BHSub) at the center of a star cluster providing energy to luminous stars (LSs) and increasing their rate of evaporation. When the self-depletion time of the BHSub exceeds the evaporation time of the LSs, a dark star cluster (DSC) will appear. Using the NBODY7 code, we performed a comprehensive set of direct \\Nbody simulations over a wide range of initial conditions to study the pure effect of the top-heaviness of the IMF on the formation of the DSC phase. In the Galactic tidal field, top-heavy IMFs lead to the fast evaporation of LSs and the formation of DSCs. Therefore, DSCs can be present even in the outer region of the Milky Way (MW). To successfully transition to the DSC phase, the MW Globular Clusters (GCs) must possess an initial BH mass fraction of $\\widetilde{\\mathit{M}}_\\mathrm{BH}(0)>0.05$. For star clusters with $\\widetilde{\\mathit{M}}_\\mathrm{BH}(0)>0.08$, the DSC phase will be created for any given initial density of the cluster and Galactocentric distance.

Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [Na/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values. This indicates that mixing and extra-mixing processes during the RGB evolution also occur at very high metallicities. Notably, no evidence of a Na-O anticorrelation, which is considered the fingerprint of genuine globular clusters, has been found. This challenges any formation scenarios that invoke the accretion of a molecular cloud or an additional stellar system onto a genuine globular cluster.

Such ``negative dynamical friction'' (NDF), in contrast to the conventional ``dynamical friction'' (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters (OCs) immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the $N$-body integration code \\rebound\\ with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed OC. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas-star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the ``kicks'' by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitative agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow-ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the stellar dynamics evolution in clusters.\n",

This approach has a higher degree of model independence than most other proposed methods, being independent of calibration of standard candles, rulers, or clocks, of the power spectrum shape (and thus also of the pre-recombination physics), of the galaxy bias, of the theory of gravity, of the dark energy model and of the background cosmology in general.

      "  - In this study, we investigate the fundamental astrophysical parameters of the old open cluster NGC 188 through two complementary methods: isochron-fitting and spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis. Using photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3, we identify 868 most likely member stars with membership probabilities $P \\geq 0.5$. The mean proper-motion components and trigonometric parallaxes of the cluster are derived as ($\\mu_{\\alpha}\\cos \\delta$, $\\mu_{\\delta}$) = (-$2.314 \\pm 0.002$, -$1.022 \\pm 0.002$) mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\\varpi = 0.550 \\pm 0.023$, respectively. From this initial selection of high probable member stars, we proceed with the determination of astrophysical parameters using the isochron-fitting method. Simultaneously estimating the colour excess, distance, and age of the cluster, we employee PARSEC isochrones to observational data on Gaia based colour-magnitude diagrams. These findings were obtained as $E(G_{BP}-G_{RP})=0.066\\pm 0.012$ mag, $d=1806 \\pm21$ pc, and $t=7.65 \\pm 1.00$ Gyr, respectively. Additionally, we identify and detected 19 previously confirmed blue straggler stars within NGC 188. Subsequently, we performed SED analyses for 412 out of the 868 cluster members. We obtained colour excess, distance and age of the cluster as $E(B-V)=0.034\\pm 0.030$ mag, $d=1854\\pm 148$ pc, and $t=7.78\\pm 0.23$ Gyr, respectively. The analysis of member stars was revealed patterns of extinction in the $V$-band, with higher values of A(V) observed in the lower right quadrant of the cluster. By comparing our results of SED analysis with models of stellar evolution, particularly in terms of temperature and surface gravity, we confirm agreement with theoretical predictions. This comprehensive investigation sheds light on the astrophysical properties of NGC 188, contributing to our understanding of stellar evolution within open clusters.\n",

      "  - A $33\\,M_\\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\\,M_\\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) that is a member of the ED-2 stellar stream. This paper investigates whether the system could have formed via isolated binary evolution. I construct evolutionary models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\\,M_{\\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\\,R_{\\odot}$ as red supergiants. I then explore what combinations of initial orbit, mass loss, and natal kick can produce the period and eccentricity of Gaia BH3. Initial orbits wide enough to accommodate the BH progenitor as a red supergiant can match the observed period and eccentricity, but only if the BH formed with a significant natal kick ($v_{\\rm kick}\\gtrsim 20\\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$). These models are disfavored because such a kick would have ejected the binary from the ED-2 progenitor cluster. I conclude that Gaia BH3 likely formed through dynamical interactions, unless the BH progenitor did not expand to become a red supergiant. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant -- greatly boosting its detectability -- only for $\\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions. Both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 are likely to be discovered in Gaia DR4.\n",

      "  - Context. The star-black hole (S-BH) binary known as Gaia BH3, discovered by the Gaia Collaboration is chemically and kinematically associated with the metal-poor ED-2 stream in the Milky Way halo.   Aims. We explore the possibility that Gaia BH3 was assembled dynamically in the progenitor globular cluster (GC) of the ED-2 stream.   Methods. We used a public suite of star-by-star dynamical Monte Carlo models to identify S-BH binaries in GCs with different initial masses and (half-mass) radii.   Results. We show that a likely progenitor of the ED-2 stream was a relatively low-mass ($\\lesssim10^5M_\\odot$) GC with an initial half-mass radius of ~4 pc. Such a GC can dynamically retain a large fraction of its BH population and dissolve on the orbit of ED-2. From the suite of models we find that GCs produce ~ 3 - 30 S-BH binaries, approximately independent of initial GC mass and inversely correlated with initial cluster radius. Scaling the results to the Milky Way GC population, we find that ~75% of the S-BH binaries formed in GCs are ejected from their host GC, all in the early phases of evolution ($\\lesssim1$ Gyr); these are expected to no longer be close to streams. The ~25% of S-BH binaries retained until dissolution are expected to form part of streams, such that for an initial mass of the progenitor of ED-2 of a few $10^4M_\\odot$, we expect ~2-3 S-BH to end up in the stream. GC models with metallicities similar to Gaia BH3 ($\\lesssim1\\%$ solar) include S-BH binaries with similar BH masses ($\\gtrsim30M_\\odot$), orbital periods, and eccentricities.   Conclusions. We predict the Galactic halo contains of order $10^5$ S-BH binaries that formed dynamically in GCs, a fraction of which may readily be detected in Gaia DR4. The detection of these sources provides valuable tests of BH dynamics in clusters and the possible role in formation of gravitational wave sources.\n",

This calls for a powerful theoretical effort to control the systematics and biases that may affect the data analysis. We investigate the detection technique and selection effects in the galaxy group and AGN populations of a mock eROSITA survey at the depth of eRASS:4. We create a $30\\times 30$ deg$^{2}$ mock observation based on the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder within z=0-0.2. We combine a physical background extracted from the real eFEDS background analysis with realistic simulations of X-ray emission for the hot gas, AGNs and X-ray binaries. We apply a detection procedure equivalent to the reduction done on eRASS data and evaluate the completeness and contamination to reconstruct the luminosity functions of the extended and point sources in the catalogue. We assess the completeness of extended detections as a function of the input X-ray flux and halo. We achieve full recovery of the brightest (most massive) clusters and AGNs. However, a significant fraction of galaxy groups remains undetected. Examining the gas properties between the detected and undetected galaxy groups at fixed halo mass, we observe that the detected population exhibits, on average, higher X-ray brightness compared to the undetected ones. Moreover, we find that X-ray luminosity primarily correlates with the hot gas fraction, rather than temperature or metallicity. Our simulation suggests the presence of a systematic selection effect in current surveys, resulting in X-ray survey catalogues predominantly composed of the lowest-entropy, gas-richest, and highest surface brightness halos on galaxy group scales.\n",

However, resolving outflow physics requires high resolution observations that can only be achieved in very nearby galaxies, making suitable targets rare. We present the first results from the new VLT/MUSE large program MAUVE (MUSE and ALMA Unveiling the Virgo Environment), which aims to understand the gas-star formation cycle within the context of the Virgo cluster environment. Outflows are a key part of this cycle, and we focus on the peculiar galaxy NGC 4383, which hosts a $\\sim6\\,$kpc bipolar outflow fuelled by one of Virgo's most HI-rich discs. The spectacular MUSE data reveal the clumpy structure and complex kinematics of the ionised gas in this M82-like outflow at 100 pc resolution. Using the ionised gas geometry and kinematics we constrain the opening half-angle to $\\theta=25-35^\\circ$, while the average outflow velocity is $\\sim210$ kms$^{-1}$. The emission line ratios reveal an ionisation structure where photoionisation is the dominant excitation process. The outflowing gas shows a marginally elevated gas-phase oxygen abundance compared to the disc but is lower than the central starburst, highlighting the contribution of mixing between the ejected and entrained gas. Making some assumptions about the outflow geometry, we estimate an integrated mass outflow-rate of $\\sim1.8~$M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and a corresponding mass-loading factor in the range 1.7-2.3. NGC 4383 is a useful addition to the few nearby examples of well-resolved outflows, and will provide a useful baseline for quantifying the role of outflows within the Virgo cluster.\n",

They are special systems whose detailed properties are related to their dynamical evolution and the balance between mechanisms of cluster formation and dissolution. Aims:We investigate the spatial distribution and structural parameters of six open clusters older than 1 Ga in order to constrain their dynamical evolution, and longevity.} Methods: We identify members using Gaia EDR3 data up to a distance of 150 pc from each cluster's centre. We investigate the spatial distribution of stars inside each cluster to understand their degree of mass segregation. Finally, in order to interpret the obtained radial density profiles we reproduced them using the lowered isothermal model explorer with PYTHON Limepy and spherical potential escapers stitched SPES. Results: All the studied clusters seem more extended than previously reported in the literature. The spatial distributions of three of them show some structures aligned with their orbits. They may be related to the existence of extra tidal stars. In fact, we find that about 20 % of their members have enough energy to leave the systems or are already unbound. Together with their initial masses, their distances to the Galactic plane may play significant roles in their survival. We found clear evidences that the most dynamically evolved clusters do not fill their Roche volumes, appearing more concentrated than the others.

      "  - Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) is a Local Group dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxy with a metallicity 13% of solar. At 1 Mpc, the relative isolation of WLM provides a unique opportunity to investigate the internal mechanisms of star formation at low metallicities. The earliest stages of star formation in larger spirals occur in embedded clusters within molecular clouds, but dIrrs lack the dust, heavy metals, and organized structure of spirals believed necessary to collapse the molecular clouds into stars. Despite actively forming stars, the early stages of star formation in dIrrs is not well understood. We examine the relationship between early star formation and molecular clouds at low metallicities. We utilize ALMA-detected CO cores, $\\textit{JWST}$ near-infrared (NIR) images (F090W, F150W, F250M, and F430M), and $\\textit{GALEX}$ far-ultraviolet (FUV) images of WLM to trace molecular clouds, early star formation, and longer star formation timescales respectively. We compare clumps of NIR-bright sources (referred to as objects) categorized into three types based on their proximity to FUV sources and CO cores. We find objects, independent of their location, have similar colors and magnitudes and no discernible difference in temperature. However, we find that objects near CO have higher masses than objects away from CO, independent of proximity to FUV. Additionally, objects near CO are coincident with Spitzer 8 $\\mu$m sources at a higher frequency than objects elsewhere in WLM. This suggests objects near CO may be embedded star clusters at an earlier stage of star formation, but accurate age estimates for all objects are required for confirmation.\n",

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will enable an unprecedentedly large survey of tidal features around millions of galaxies. To decipher the contributions of mergers to galaxy evolution it will be necessary to compare the observed tidal features with theoretical predictions. Therefore, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations NewHorizon, EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Magneticum to produce LSST-like mock images of $z\\sim0$ galaxies ($z\\sim0.2$ for NewHorizon) with $M_{\\scriptstyle\\star,\\text{ 30 pkpc}}\\geq10^{9.5}$ M$_{\\scriptstyle\\odot}$.

Furthermore, we find excellent agreement regarding the trends of tidal feature fraction with stellar and halo mass. All simulations agree in predicting that the majority of central galaxies of groups and clusters exhibit at least one tidal feature, while the satellite members rarely show such features. This agreement suggests that gravity is the primary driver of the occurrence of visually-identifiable tidal features in cosmological simulations, rather than subgrid physics or hydrodynamics.

For this comparison, we introduce a new observable that does not require previous knowledge of the cluster mass: the X-ray mean surface brightness within the central 300 kpc. We found that clusters with low surface brightness, defined as those with a mean surface brightness below 43.35 \\subr , are about one quarter of the whole cluster population in a sample of 32 clusters in the nearby Universe, selected independently of the intracluster medium properties. Almost no example of a low central surface brightness cluster exists instead in two X-ray selected samples, one sample based on XMM-Newton XXL-100 survey data and the other on full-depth eROSITA eFEDS data, although these clusters are known to exist in the range of redshift and mass as probed by these two surveys. Furthermore, the Sunayev-Zeldovich Atacama Cosmology Telescope cluster survey is even more selective than the previous two samples because it does not even include clusters with intermediate surface brightness, which are instead present in X-ray selected samples that explore the same volume of the Universe. Finally, a measure of the mean surface brightness, which is obtained without knowledge of the mass, proves to be effective in narrowing the number of clusters to be followed-up because it recognizes those with a low gas fraction or with a low X-ray luminosity for their mass. Identifying these would otherwise require knowledge of the mass for all clusters.\n",

We find that clustering, lensing and peculiar velocity effects impact estimates for future detectors such as Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO. The signal-to-noise ratio of the angular power spectrum of the average luminosity distance over all the redshift bins is 17 in the case of binary black holes detected by Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

      "  - Research has shown that many young and intermediate-age clusters (younger than $\\sim$2 Gyr) have extended main sequences and main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs), which cannot be adequately described by a single isochrone. The reason for the extended main sequences is now known, with the most probable cause being the fast rotation of stars. However, a significant fraction of slowly rotating stars form a younger stellar population than their fast-rotating counterparts, leading to speculation that they have undergone thorough rotational mixing processes internally. One speculation is that a considerable number of slowly rotating stars reside in close binary systems, where tidal forces from companion stars are the cause of their rotational deceleration. In this work, we report a relatively old open star cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 2423 ($\\sim$1 Gyrs old), which exhibits an apparent eMSTO. As anticipated, many characteristics of NGC 2423 indicate that its eMSTO is driven by stellar rotations. Our calculations indicate that if slowly rotating stars commonly have a close companion star, they should exhibit significant differences in radial velocities observationally, and binary systems that can be tidally locked within the age of NGC 2423 should have a mass ratio close to 1. However, none of these predictions align with our observations. Interestingly, among the only two equal-mass binary systems in the observed region for which spectroscopic data could be obtained, we discovered that one of them is a tidally locked binary system. This further suggests the validity of our numerical simulation results.\n",

In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \\phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.\n",

      "  - Future data provided by the Euclid mission will allow us to better understand the cosmic history of the Universe. A metric of its performance is the figure-of-merit (FoM) of dark energy, usually estimated with Fisher forecasts. The expected FoM has previously been estimated taking into account the two main probes of Euclid, namely the three-dimensional clustering of the spectroscopic galaxy sample, and the so-called 3x2pt signal from the photometric sample (i.e., the weak lensing signal, the galaxy clustering, and their cross-correlation). So far, these two probes have been treated as independent. In this paper, we introduce a new observable given by the ratio of the (angular) two-point correlation function of galaxies from the two surveys. For identical (normalised) selection functions, this observable is unaffected by sampling noise, and its variance is solely controlled by Poisson noise. We present forecasts for Euclid where this multi-tracer method is applied and is particularly relevant because the two surveys will cover the same area of the sky. This method allows for the exploitation of the combination of the spectroscopic and photometric samples. When the correlation between this new observable and the other probes is not taken into account, a significant gain is obtained in the FoM, as well as in the constraints on other cosmological parameters. The benefit is more pronounced for a commonly investigated modified gravity model, namely the $\\gamma$ parametrisation of the growth factor. However, the correlation between the different probes is found to be significant and hence the actual gain is uncertain. We present various strategies for circumventing this issue and still extract useful information from the new observable.\n",

This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe. We discuss the impact of an instability in the hadronic phase separating a low density, positive-strange-charge phase from a high-density phase with a negative strange charge. This second phase can rapidly stabilize by forming color-superconducting gaps. The strangelets then undergo partial evaporation. In this way, we obtain distributions of their sizes in agreement with the observational constraints and we discuss the many astrophysical and cosmological implications of these objects. Finally, we examine the most promising techniques to detect this type of strangelets. We also show that strangelets can exist with masses $\\lesssim10^{17} \\mathrm g$, while primordial black holes are ruled out in that mass range, allowing us to distinguish between these two dark matter candidates.\n",

In this paper we explore the impact of injecting heat into stars with masses near the main sequence turnoff mass (1.26 $M_\\odot$) of the open cluster M67. The heating rate is obtained from the tidal shear energy dissipation rate which is calculated from first principles by simultaneously solving the equations that describe orbital motion and the response of a star's layers to the gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, gas pressure and viscous forces. The stellar structure models are computed with MESA. We focus on the effects of injecting heat in pulses lasting 0.01 Gyr, a timeframe consistent with the synchonization timescale in binary systems. We find that the location of the tidally perturbed stars in the M67 color-magnitude diagram is shifted to significantly higher luminosities and effective temperatures than predicted by the standard model isochrone and include locations corresponding to some of the Blue Straggler Stars. Because tidal heating takes energy from the orbit causing it to shrink, Blue Straggler Stars could be merger or mass-transfer progenitors as well as products of these processes.\n",

      "  - Very massive stars (VMSs) formed via a sequence of stellar collisions in dense star clusters have been proposed as the progenitors of massive black hole seeds. VMSs could indeed collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which would then grow by accretion to become the supermassive black holes observed at the centers of galaxies and powering high-redshift quasars. Previous studies have investigated how different cluster initial conditions affect the formation of a VMS, including mass segregation, stellar collisions, and binaries, among others. In this study, we investigate the growth of VMSs with a new grid of Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) star cluster simulations -- the most expansive to date. The simulations span a wide range of initial conditions, varying the number of stars, cluster density, stellar initial mass function (IMF), and primordial binary fraction. We find a gradual shift in the mass of the most massive collision product across the parameter space; in particular, denser clusters born with top-heavy IMFs provide strong collisional regimes that form VMSs with masses easily exceeding 1000 solar masses. Our results are used to derive a fitting formula that can predict the typical mass of a VMS formed as a function of the star cluster properties. Additionally, we study the stochasticity of this process and derive a statistical distribution for the mass of the VMS formed in one of our models, recomputing the model 50 times with different initial random seeds.\n",

      "  - The Gaia Collaboration has recently reported the detection of a 33 M$_\\odot$ black hole in a wide binary system located in the Solar neighbourhood. Here we explore the relationship between this black hole, known as Gaia BH3, and the nearby ED-2 halo stellar stream. We study the orbital characteristics of the Gaia BH3 binary and present measurements of the chemical abundances of ED-2 member stars derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with the VLT. We find that the Galactic orbit of the Gaia BH3 system and its metallicity are entirely consistent with being part of the ED-2 stream. The characteristics of the stream, particularly its negligible spread in metallicity and in other chemical elements as well as its single stellar population, suggest that it originated from a disrupted star cluster of low mass. Its age is comparable to that of the globular cluster M92 that has been estimated to be as old as the Universe. This is the first black hole unambiguously associated with a disrupted star cluster. We infer a plausible mass range for the cluster to be relatively narrow, between $2\\times 10^3M_\\odot$ and $4.2\\times 10^4M_\\odot$. This implies that the black hole could have formed directly from the collapse of a massive very-metal-poor star, but that the alternative scenario of binary interactions inside the cluster environment also deserves to be explored.\n",

      "  - The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses that form in a given star formation event. The long main-sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars mean that the IMF in this regime (below $\\sim 1 \\rm{M}_\\odot$) can be investigated through star counts. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are low-luminosity systems with ancient, metal-poor stellar populations. We investigate the low-mass IMF in four such systems (Reticulum II, Ursa Major II, Triangulum II, and Segue 1), using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data that reaches to $\\lesssim 0.2 \\rm{M}_\\odot$ in each galaxy. The analysis techniques that we adopt depend on the number of low-mass stars in each sample. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for all four galaxies to determine whether their observed apparent magnitude distributions can reject a given combination of IMF parameters and binary fraction for the underlying population. We forward model 1000 synthetic populations for each combination of parameters, and reject those parameters only if each of the 1000 realizations reject the null hypothesis. We find that all four galaxies reject a variety of IMFs, and the IMFs that they cannot reject include those that are identical, or similar, to that of the stellar populations of the Milky Way. We determine the best-fit parameter values for the IMF in Reticulum II and Ursa Major II and find that the IMF in Reticulum II is generally consistent with that of the Milky Way, while the IMF in Ursa Major II is more bottom heavy. The interpretation of the results for Ursa Major II is complicated by possible contamination from two known background galaxy clusters.\n",

      "  - We study the properties of one of the most luminous hinge clumps, located on the compact group of galaxies NGC6845. Using IFS from GMOS/Gemini, complemented with archival MUSE data, we obtain oxygen abundances, ages, star formation rates, velocity fields and we also performed a single stellar populations modeling to understand the SFH of the hinge clump localized in NGC6845. We found that the hinge clump sits in a tail, having a SFR of 3.4$M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$, which is comparable with a few other extreme cases, e.g., the star clusters in the Antennae galaxy and other reported hinge clumps in the literature. In fact, this clump represents ~15\\% of total SFR of NGC6845A. Large-scale modeling of the observed velocity field of NGC6845A rules out the scenario on which this hinge clump was a satellite galaxy. Indeed, its kinematics is compatible with the galactic disk of NGC6845A. Its abundance, mean value of 0.4Z$_{\\odot}$, is also consistent with the metallicity gradient of the galaxy. Our analysis, suggest that the hinge clump is formed by multiple stellar populations instead of a single burst, thus having a large range of ages. We found that central clump is encompassed by a ring-like structure, suggesting that the ring-like structure represents a second-generation of star formation. In addition, the analysis of the diagnostic diagram indicates that this central region can also be being ionized by shock from stellar and supernovae winds. Finally, the derived SFR density $\\Sigma=9.7M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2}$ of the central clump, place it in starburst regime, where gas inflows should provide gas to maintain the star formation. This work shows a resolved example of an extreme localized starburst in a compact group of galaxies.\n",

We derive expressions for the neutrino density, using a perturbative approach to kinetic field theory and perturbative solutions of the Vlasov equation up to second order. Our work reveals that both formalisms give exactly the same results and can thus be considered equivalent. Numerical evaluation of the local relic neutrino density at first and second order provides some fundamental insights into the frequently applied approach of linear response to neutrino clustering (also known as the Gilbert equation). Against the naive expectation, including the second-order contribution does not lead to an improvement of the prediction for the local relic neutrino density but to a dramatic overestimation.

      "  - Density profiles are important tools in galaxy cluster research, offering insights into clusters dynamical states and their relationship with the broader Universe. While these profiles provide valuable information about the matter content of the Universe, their utility in understanding its dark energy component has remained limited due a lack of tools allowing us to study the transition from cluster portions that are relaxed and infalling, to those that are merging with the Hubble flow. In this work we investigate signatures of this transition in stacked density profiles of simulated cluster-sized halos at different redshifts. To highlight the Hubble flow around clusters we use their turnaround radius to normalize stacked simulated density profiles and calculate their logarithmic slope. Then, we complement our analysis by modeling the outer portions of these profiles assuming Gaussian early Universe statistics and spherical collapse without shell-crossing. We find the logarithmic slope of median cluster density profiles beyond the turnaround radius - where the Hubble flow dominates - to be Universal and well described by our model. Importantly, we find the slope of the profiles to diverge from the SCM prediction from within the turnaround radius where the actual profiles exhibit caustics which give rise to the splashback feature. We suggest utilizing this divergence from the spherical collapse model as a method to identify the turnaround radius in stacked cluster density profiles, offering a new perspective on understanding cluster dynamics and their cosmological implications.\n",

      "  - The aim of this work is to measure the abundances of n-capture elements in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs that were formed in globular clusters, and subsequently became unbound from the cluster. These N-rich stars, HD 25329, HD 74000, HD 160617, G 24-3, G 53-41, and G 90-3, were previously studied in Paper I. The abundances of the n-capture elements in these stars were compared to the abundances in normal metal-poor dwarfs and in globular cluster stars in the same metallicity range in order to find evidence of an enrichment of the material from which these N-rich stars were formed, by the ejecta of massive asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB) inside the cluster.The abundances of 15 elements, from Sr to Yb, were derived line by line by comparing the observed profiles to synthetic spectra in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs and nine classical metal-poor dwarfs. We show that, generally speaking, the behaviours of the intermediate metal-poor stars here studied and the extremely metal-poor stars are very different. In particular, the scatter of the [X/Fe] ratios is much smaller since many more stars contribute to the enrichment.Among our six metal-poor N-rich stars, three stars (G24-3 and HD 74000 and maybe also HD 160617) present an enrichment in elements formed by the s-process, typical of a contribution of AGB stars, unexpected at the metallicity of these stars. This suggests that the intracluster medium from which these stars were formed was enriched by a first generation of massive AGB stars. Another N-rich star, G53-41, is also rich in s-process elements, but since it is more metal-rich this could be due to the normal galactic enrichment by low-mass AGB stars before the formation of the cluster. In contrast, two stars (G90-3 and HD 25329) have an abundance pattern compatible with a pure r-process such as that seen in metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]<--1.5.\n",

In addition to embedded Class 0/I protostars in continuum, a number of complex dense filamentary structures are detected in the C18O and SO lines by the 7m array. These are sub-structures of the molecular clump that are detected by the TP array as the extended emission. We identify 101 and 37 filamentary structures with a few thousand AU widths in C18O and SO, respectively, called as feathers. The typical column density of the feathers in C18O is about 10^{22} cm^{-2}, and the volume density and line mass are ~ 10^5 cm^{-3}, and a few times M_{sun} pc^{-1}, respectively. This line mass is significantly smaller than the critical line mass expected for cold and dense gas. These structures have complex velocity fields, indicating a turbulent internal property. The number of feathers associated with Class 0/I protostars is only ~ 10, indicating that most of them do not form stars but rather being transient structures. The formation of feathers can be interpreted as a result of colliding gas flow as the morphology well reproduced by MHD simulations, supported by the the presence of HI shells in the vicinity. The colliding gas flows may accumulate gas and form filaments and feathers, and trigger the active star formation of the R CrA cluster.\n",

      "  - We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for $m_{ax} < 10^{-21.6}$ eV and limit axions with $-26 < \\log( m_{ax}/{eV}) < -23$ to be less than $22\\%$ of the DM (both limits at $95\\%$ credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts $4 < z < 10$. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest. These high-$z$ measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-$z$ tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-$z$ galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming $\\Lambda$CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos ($< 10^9 M_\\odot$) at $z < 3$, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).\n",

However, in recent years, a growing set of observational evidence is unveiling an unexpected dynamical complexity in Galactic GCs. Indeed, kinematic studies show that a measurable amount of internal rotation is present in many present-day GCs. Aims. The objective of this work is to analyse the APOGEE-2 Value-Added Catalogs (VACs) DR17 data of a sample of 21 GCs to extend the sample showing signatures of systemic rotation, in order to better understand the kinematic properties of GCs in general. Also, we aim to identify the fastest rotating GC from the sample of objects with suitable measurements. Methods. From the sample of 23 GCs included in this work, the presence of systemic rotation was detected in 21 of the GCs, using three different methods. All these methods use the radial velocity referred to the cluster systemic velocity. Using the first method, it was possible to visually verify the clear-cut signature of systemic rotation. Whereas, using the second and third methods, it was possible to determine the amplitude of the rotation curve and the position angle of the rotation axis. Results. This study shows that 21 GCs have a signature of systemic rotation. For these clusters, the rotation amplitude and the position angle of the rotation axis have been calculated. The clusters cover a remarkable range of rotational amplitudes, from 0.77 km/s to 13.85 km/s.\n",

These projects aim to tackle a large number of astrophysical topics, encompassing both the galactic and extragalactic fields. In that sense, generating large catalogues with homogeneous photometry for both resolved and unresolved sources that might be interesting to achieve specific goals, imposes a compromise when choosing the set of parameters to automatically detect and measure such a plethora of objects. In this work we present the acquired experience on studying the galaxy content of the Fornax cluster using large catalogues obtained by the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). We realized that some Fornax bright galaxies are missed in the S-PLUS iDR4 catalogues. In addition, Fornax star-forming galaxies are included as multiple detections due to over-deblending. To solve those issues, we performed specific SExtractor runs to identify the proper set of parameters to recover as many Fornax galaxies as possible with confident photometry and avoiding duplications. From that process, we obtained new catalogs containing 12-band improved photometry for ~ 3 x 10^6 resolved and unresolved sources in an area of ~ 208 deg2 in the direction of the Fornax cluster. Together with identifying the main difficulties to carry out the study of nearby groups and clusters of galaxies using S-PLUS catalogs, we also share possible solutions to face issues that seem to be common to other ongoing photometric surveys.\n",

      "  - The Universe is shaped as a web-like structure, formed by clusters, filaments, and walls that leave large volumes in between named voids. Galaxies in voids have been found to be of a later type, bluer, less massive, and to have a slower evolution than galaxies in denser environments (filaments and walls). However, the effect of the void environment on their stellar population properties is still unclear. We aim to address this question using 118 optical integral field unit datacubes from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY), observed with the PMAS/PPaK spectrograph at the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (Almer\\'ia, Spain). We used the non-parametric full spectral fitting code STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar population properties: stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, age, star formation rate (SFR), and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We analysed the results through the global and spatially resolved properties. Then, we compared them with a control sample of galaxies in filaments and walls from the CALIFA survey, matched in stellar mass and morphological type. Key findings include void galaxies having a slightly higher half-light radius (HLR), lower stellar mass surface density, and younger ages across all morphological types, and slightly elevated SFR and sSFR (only significant enough for Sas). Many of these differences appear in the outer parts of spiral galaxies in voids (HLR > 1), which are younger and exhibit a higher sSFR, indicative of less evolved discs. This trend is also found for early-type spirals, suggesting a slower transition from star-forming to quiescent states in voids. Our analysis indicates that void galaxies, influenced by their surroundings, undergo a more gradual evolution, especially in their outer regions, with a more pronounced effect for low-mass galaxies.\n",

      "  - Deep imaging of galaxy cluster fields have in recent years revealed tens of candidates for gravitationally lensed stars at redshifts $z\\approx$ 1-6, and future searches are expected to reveal highly magnified stars from even earlier epochs. Multi-band photometric observations may be used to constrain the redshift, effective temperature $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ and dust attenuation along the line of sight to such objects. When combined with an estimate of the likely magnification, these quantities may be converted into a constraint on the stellar luminosity and, for an adopted set of stellar evolutionary tracks, the initial stellar mass. Further characterization is, however, difficult without spectroscopic observations, which at the typical brightness levels of high-redshift lensed stars becomes extremely challenging for even the largest existing telescopes. Here, we explore what spectral features one can realistically hope to detect in lensed stars with peak brightness in the range 26-28 AB mag, $T_\\mathrm{eff}=$ 4000-50 000 K and redshifts $z=$1-10, using spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope.

This paper focuses on the most massive structures: galaxy clusters with a mean mass of M$_{500c}$ = 2.7$\\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We used a large number of background quasar optical spectra from SDSS DR16 to probe the diffuse T$=$10$^4$K gas in their intracluster medium. We first analysed a sample of spectra with known MgII absorbers, and then blindly stacked about 16,000 archival spectra at the redshifts of the foreground galaxy clusters. We tentatively ($3.7 \\sigma$ significance) detect MgII in the clusters with an equivalent width EW(MgII $\\lambda$2796) of 0.056$\\pm$0.015 \\r{A}, corresponding to a column density of log [N(MgII)/cm$^{-2}$]=12.12$\\pm0.1$.

We also performed bootstrapping stacking at different cluster redshifts and stacked quasar spectra with no intervening clusters in the line of sight to measure the significance of our detection. These results are in line with the findings of recent, similar observational studies but challenge predictions from TNG simulations.

The QGs quench via diverse pathways, both rapid and slow, and exhibit a wide range of times elapsed between the quenching event and cold gas removal (from $\\sim650$ Myr to $\\sim8$ Gyr). We find that quenching modes attributed to the feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) do not affect dust and cold gas within the same timescales. Remarkably, QGs may replenish their dust content in the quenched phase primarily due to internal processes and marginally by external factors such as minor mergers. The key mechanism for re-formation of dust is prolonged grain growth on gas-phase metals, it is effective within $\\sim100$ Myr after the quenching event, and rapidly increases the dust-to-gas mass ratio in QGs above the standard values ($\\delta_{\\rm DGR}\\gtrsim1/100$). As a result, despite heavily depleted cold gas reservoirs, roughly half of QGs maintain little evolution in their ISM dust with stellar age within the first 2 Gyr following the quenching. Overall, we predict that relatively dusty QGs ($M_{\\rm dust}/M_{\\star}\\gtrsim10^{-3}-10^{-4}$) arise from both fast and slow quenchers, and are prevalent in systems of intermediate and low stellar masses ($9<\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})<10.5$). This prediction poses an immediate quest for observational synergy between e.g., James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).\n",

We find that metals ejected from stellar wind are accumulated, leading to subsequent star formation in the nitrogen-enriched gas. During this early phase, the N/O ratios are similar to observed nitrogen-enriched galaxies (${\\rm [N/O]}\\gtrsim0.5$). Then, once supernovae occur, the N/O ratios decrease significantly. If the duration of star formation is comparable to the timescale of SNe, the mass fraction of nitrogen-enriched stars reaches half the mass of star clusters.

      "  - Gravitational waves from black-hole merging events have revealed a population of extra-galactic BHs residing in short-period binaries with masses that are higher than expected based on most stellar evolution models - and also higher than known stellar-origin black holes in our Galaxy. It has been proposed that those high-mass BHs are the remnants of massive metal-poor stars. Gaia astrometry is expected to uncover many Galactic wide-binary systems containing dormant BHs, which may not have been detected before. The study of this population will provide new information on the BH-mass distribution in binaries and shed light on their formation mechanisms and progenitors. As part of the validation efforts in preparation for the fourth Gaia data release (DR4), we analysed the preliminary astrometric binary solutions, obtained by the Gaia Non-Single Star pipeline, to verify their significance and to minimise false-detection rates in high-mass-function orbital solutions. The astrometric binary solution of one source, Gaia BH3, implies the presence of a 32.70 \\pm 0.82 M\\odot BH in a binary system with a period of 11.6 yr. Gaia radial velocities independently validate the astrometric orbit. Broad-band photometric and spectroscopic data show that the visible component is an old, very metal-poor giant of the Galactic halo, at a distance of 590 pc. The BH in the Gaia BH3 system is more massive than any other Galactic stellar-origin BH known thus far. The low metallicity of the star companion supports the scenario that metal-poor massive stars are progenitors of the high-mass BHs detected by gravitational-wave telescopes. The Galactic orbit of the system and its metallicity indicate that it might belong to the Sequoia halo substructure. Alternatively, and more plausibly, it could belong to the ED-2 stream, which likely originated from a globular cluster that had been disrupted by the Milky Way.\n",

Dust polarization observations of the massive protocluster G31.41+0.31 carried out at ~1'' (~3750 au) resolution with the SMA at 870 microm have revealed one of the clearest examples to date of an hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology in the high-massregime. Additionally, ~0.24'' (~900 au) resolution observations with ALMA at 1.3 mm have confirmed these results. The next step is to investigate whether the magnetic field maintains its hourglass-shaped morphology down to circumstellar scales. Aims. To study the magnetic field morphology toward the four (proto)stars A, B, C, and D contained in G31.41+0.31 and examine whether the self-similarity observed at core scales (1'' and 0.24'' resolution) still holds at circumstellar scales, we carried out ALMA observations of the polarized dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3.1 mm at an angular resolution of ~0.068'' (~250 au), sufficient to resolve the envelope emission of the embedded protostars. Methods. We used ALMA to perform full polarization observations at 233 GHz (Band 6) and 97.5 GHz (Band 3) with a synthesized beam of 0.072'' x 0.064''. We carried out polarization observations at two different wavelengths to confirm that the polarization traces magnetically aligned dust grains and is not due to dust self-scattering. Results. The polarized emission and the direction of the magnetic field obtained at the two wavelengths are basically the same, except for an area between the embedded sources C and B. In such an area, the emission at 1.3 mm could be optically thick and affected by dichroic extinction. ...\n",

We utilize wide and deep field observations of the CFHT as part of the NGVS to investigate the GCS of NGC4262. We presented the first optical image of NGC4262 with an optically faint ring component. The photometric analysis of the GCS displays a distinct color bimodality. We estimate the total number of GCs for NGC4262 to be 266$\\pm$16 GCs with a specific frequency of 4.2$\\pm$0.8 and a specific mass of 0.23$\\pm$0.01, which is relatively high compared to other galaxies of similar mass and environmental conditions.

      "  - Metallicity offers a unique window into the baryonic history of the cosmos, being instrumental in probing evolutionary processes in galaxies between different cosmic environments. We aim to quantify the contribution of these environments to the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of galaxies. By analysing the galaxy distribution within the cosmic skeleton of the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation at redshift $z = 0.625$, computed using a careful calibration of the T-ReX filament finder, we identify galaxies within three main environments: nodes, filaments and voids. We also classify galaxies based on the dynamical state of the clusters and the length of the filaments in which they reside. We find that the cosmic environment significantly contributes to the scatter in the MZR; in particular, both the gas metallicity and its average relative standard deviation increase when considering denser large-scale environments. The difference in the average metallicity between galaxies within relaxed and unrelaxed clusters is $\\approx 0.1 \\text{ dex}$, with both populations displaying positive residuals, $\\delta Z_{g}$, from the averaged MZR. Moreover, the difference in metallicity between node and void galaxies accounts for $\\approx 0.14 \\, \\text{dex}$ in the scatter of the MZR at stellar mass $M_{\\star} \\approx 10^{9.35}\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$. Finally, both the average [O/Fe] in the gas and the galaxy gas fraction decrease when moving to higher large-scale densities in the simulation, suggesting that the cores of cosmic environments host, on average, older and more massive galaxies, whose enrichment is affected by a larger number of Type Ia Supernova events.\n",

      "  - The precise measurement of stellar abundances plays a pivotal role in providing constraints on the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. However, before spectral lines can be employed as reliable abundance indicators, particularly for challenging elements such as helium, they must undergo thorough scrutiny. Galactic open clusters, representing well-defined single stellar populations, offer an ideal setting for unfolding the information stored in the helium spectral line feature. In this study, we characterize the profile and strength of the helium transition at around 10830{\\AA} (He 10830) in nine giant stars in the Galactic open cluster Stock 2. To remove the influence of weak blending lines near the helium feature, we calibrated their oscillator strengths ($\\log gf$) by employing corresponding abundances obtained from simultaneously observed optical spectra. Our observations reveal that He 10830 in all the targets is observed in absorption, with line strengths categorized into two groups. Three stars exhibit strong absorption, including a discernible secondary component, while the remaining stars exhibit weaker absorption. The lines are in symmetry and align with or around their rest wavelengths, suggesting a stable upper chromosphere without a significant systematic mass motion. We found a correlation between He 10830 strength and Ca II $\\log{R'_\\mathrm{HK}}$ index, with a slope similar to that reported in previous studies on dwarf stars. This correlation underscores the necessity of accounting for stellar chromosphere structure when employing He 10830 as a probe for stellar helium abundance. The procedure of measuring the He 10830 we developed in this study is applicable not only to other Galactic open clusters but also to field stars, with the aim of mapping helium abundance across various types of stars in the future.\n",

In this sense, we propose here the exploration of a large dataset in a top-down fashion, elaborating a similarity map of the local Galactic volume in order to segregate and characterise its main components, searching for hints about their relations. We have used the t-SNE algorithm with chemical, orbital and kinematic properties of the stars to produce 2D manifolds and dissect their structure by isolating populations to further analyse their behaviour. The young thin disk could be clearly separated from the older thick disk, also showing a puzzling transition zone with hints about the aftermath of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger. Moving groups and resonant features also appear prominently in the maps, splitting the disk into inner and outer portions as consequence of the resonances produced by the Galactic bar. The dynamical halo appears as an extreme end related to the heated portion of the thick disk, showing sub-structures corresponding to known accreted populations. Open and globular clusters also appear in their chemical/evolutionary context.

The obtained groups demonstrate concordance with the BL Lac/FSRQ classification along with a continuous character of the change in the properties. The group of HSP blazars stands out against the overall distribution. We examine the characteristics of the five groups and demonstrate distinctions in their spectral energy distribution shapes.

In this Letter, we use the most recent 3D dust map by Edenhofer et al. to study the well-known Chameleon, Musca, and Coalsack cloud complexes, located about 200 pc from the Sun. We find that these three complexes are not isolated but rather connect to form a surprisingly well-defined half-ring, constituting a single C-shaped cloud with a radius of about 50 pc, a thickness of about 45 pc, and a total mass of about $5 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, or $9 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ if including everything in the vicinity of the C-shaped cloud. Despite the absence of an evident feedback source at its center, the dynamics of young stellar clusters associated with the C structure suggest that a single supernova explosion about 4 Myr to 10 Myr ago likely shaped this structure. Our findings support a single origin story for these cloud complexes, suggesting that they were formed by feedback-driven gas compression, and offer new insights into the processes that govern the birth of star-forming clouds in feedback-dominated regions, such as the Scorpius-Centaurus association.\n",

The multi-fractal analysis used for this purpose considers the scaling behavior of different moments of quasar distribution in different density environments. This analysis gives the spectrum of generalized dimension $D_q$, where positive values of $q$ characterize the scaling behavior in over-dense regions and the negative ones in under-dense regions. We expect fractal correlation dimension $D_q(r) = 3$, for a homogeneous, random point distribution in 3-Dimensions. The fractal correlation dimension $D_q(r)$, corresponding to $q=2$ obtained in our study stabilizes in the range (2.8-2.9) for scales $r>80$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The observed quasar distribution shows consistency with the simulated mock data and the random distribution of quasars within one sigma. Further, the generalized dimension spectrum $D_q(r)$ also reveals transition to homogeneity beyond $>110$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, and the dominance of clustering at small scales $r<80$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Consequently, our study provides strong evidence for the homogeneity in SDSS quasar distribution, offering insights into large-scale structure properties and, thus can play a pivotal role in scrutinizing the clustering properties of quasars and its evolution in various upcoming surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).\n",

Tidal disruption events (TDEs), where a star is tidally disrupted by the gravitational field of a black hole, have been observed to occur around the supermassive black holes (SMBH) found at the centres of galaxies, and should also arise around IMBHs, especially in the dense stellar cores of CSS's. However, to date none have been observed in such environments. Using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) we search for TDEs associated with CSS, but none are found. This non-detection allows us to set an upper limit on the TDE rate in CSS of $n_\\text{TDE,Total}\\lessapprox10^{-7} CSS^{-1}\\text{yr}^{-1}$ which is two dex. below the observed TDE rate involving SMBH interacting with 1\\Msun\\ main sequence stars in the nuclei of massive galaxies.

Using Ultraviolet(UV)-optical-NearIR(NIR) photometry obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have recovered 99 compact sources exhibiting emission in the Pa$\\beta$ hydrogen recombination line. Our analysis reveals these sources possess masses $10^{2}<M_{\\odot}<10^{5}$, ages 1-20 Myr, and color excess E(B - V) in the range 0-1.4. After selecting clusters with mass above 3,000M$_{\\odot}$ to mitigate stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, we find that our IR-selected clusters have a median mass of $\\sim$7$\\times{10^{3}\\text{ M}_{\\odot}}$ and remain embedded in their surrounding gas and dust for 5-6 Myr. In contrast, line-emitting sources selected from existing UV/optically catalogs have a median mass of $\\sim$3.5$\\times{10^{4}\\text{ M}_{\\odot}}$ and have cleared their surroundings by 4 Myr. We further find that the environment in NGC4449 is too low pressure to drive these differences. We interpret these findings as evidence that the clearing timescale from pre-supernova and supernova feedback is cluster mass-dependent. Even in clusters with mass$\\sim$7,000~M$_{\\odot}$, stochastic sampling of the upper end of the stellar initial mass function is present, randomly decreasing the number of massive stars available to inject energy and momentum into the surrounding medium. This effect may increase the clearing timescales in these clusters by decreasing the effectiveness of both pre-supernova and supernova feedback; neither models nor observations have so far explored such dependence explicitly. Future studies and observations with, e.g., the JWST, will fill this gap.\n",

Analysing JWST NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopic data and Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the inner 330 $\\times$ 330 pc, we find that the nucleus harbours in fact three massive star clusters. Maps of infrared emission lines from NIRSpec show different morphologies for the ionised and molecular gas components. The emission from molecular hydrogen gas is concentrated at the NSC location, while emission from hydrogen recombination lines is more extended beyond the central cluster. The velocity fields of both gas and stars indicate that the three clusters are part of a complicated dynamical system, with the NSC having an elevated velocity dispersion in line with its high stellar mass. To investigate the stellar populations of the three clusters in more detail, we use surface brightness modelling to measure their fluxes from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths and fit their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Two of the clusters are UV-bright and well described by single stellar populations with young ages ($\\sim$ 3 and 5 Myr) and low masses ($M_\\ast \\sim 4 \\times 10^{4} - 10^{5} M_\\odot$), whereas the central cluster is much more massive ($3 \\times 10^7 M_\\odot$), and cannot be fitted by a single stellar population. Instead, we find that a minor young population ($\\sim$ 1 Myr) embedded in a dominant old population ($\\sim$ 8 Gyr) is needed to explain its SED. Given its complex composition and the close proximity of two young star clusters that are likely to merge with it within a few hundred million years, we consider NGC4654 a unique laboratory to study NSC growth from both in-situ star formation and the infall of star clusters.\n",

As the brightest known lensed galaxy, the Sunburst Arc has become an important cosmic laboratory for studying star and cluster formation, Lyman $\\alpha$ radiative transfer, and Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape. Here, we present the first results of JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the Sunburst Arc, focusing on a stacked spectrum of the 12-fold imaged LyC-emitting (Sunburst LCE) cluster. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the cluster is massive and compact, with $M_{\\text{dyn}} = (9\\pm1) \\times 10^{6} M_{\\odot}$, Our age estimate of 4.2--4.5 Myr is much larger than the crossing time of $t_{\\text{cross}} = 183 \\pm 9 $ kyr, indicating that the cluster is dynamically evolved and consistent with being gravitationally bound.

The strength of the WR signatures cannot be reproduced by stellar population models that only include single-star evolution. While models with binary evolution better match the WR features, they still struggle to reproduce the nitrogen-enhanced WR features. JWST reveals the Sunburst LCE to be a highly ionized, proto-globular cluster with low oxygen abundance and extreme nitrogen enhancement that hosts a population of Wolf-Rayet stars, and possibly Very Massive stars (VMSs), which are rapidly enriching the surrounding medium.\n",

      "  - We report the discovery of transients among star clusters in a distant galaxy that is gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy cluster, and explore whether these transients correspond to: (i) intrinsic variations associated with stellar outbursts; or (ii) extrinsic variations imposed through microlensing by intraclusters stars along, perhaps, with primordial black holes. From images at two epochs separated by nearly a year, we discovered ten such transients -- displaying brightness variations of $\\sim$10\\%--20\\% -- among 55 persistent knots identified as young star clusters in the Dragon arc. Two of these transients are associated with a triply-lensed star cluster, permitting a test of intrinsic variability by checking whether their light variations are repeated among the different lensed counterparts with a suitable time delay given their different light arrival times at the observer. Despite considerable care in constructing a lens model for Abell 370 that is optimized at the Dragon arc, we found that the predicted lensing magnifications are not sufficiently accurate to provide a definitive test of intrinsic variability based only on two images -- although such a test will become feasible as more observations are made. On the other hand, we perform simulations demonstrating that the observed level of brightness variations, as well as the observed transient event rate, can be explained entirely by stellar microlensing: as stars in the background star cluster move across the sky relative to intracluster stars, changes in their individual brightnesses can result in an overall change in the brightness of their parent star cluster.\n",

      "  - The relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect can be used to measure intracluster gas temperatures independently of X-ray spectroscopy. Here, we use the large-volume FLAMINGO simulation suite to determine whether SZ $y$-weighted temperatures lead to more accurate hydrostatic mass estimates in massive ($M_{\\rm 500c} > 7.5\\times 10^{14}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) clusters than when using X-ray spectroscopic-like temperatures. We find this to be the case, on average. The median bias in the SZ mass at redshift zero is $\\left< b \\right> \\equiv 1-\\left< M_{\\rm 500c,hse}/M_{\\rm 500c,true} \\right> = -0.05 \\pm 0.01$, over 4 times smaller in magnitude than the X-ray spectroscopic-like case, $\\left< b \\right> = 0.22 \\pm 0.01$. However, the scatter in the SZ bias, $\\sigma_{b} \\approx 0.2$, is around 40 per cent larger than for the X-ray case. We show that this difference is strongly affected by clusters with large pressure fluctuations, as expected from shocks in ongoing mergers. Selecting the clusters with the best-fitting generalized NFW pressure profiles, the median SZ bias almost vanishes, $\\left< b \\right> = -0.009 \\pm 0.005$, and the scatter is halved to $\\sigma_{b} \\approx 0.1$. We study the origin of the SZ/X-ray difference and find that, at $R_{\\rm 500c}$ and in the outskirts, SZ weighted gas better reflects the hot, hydrostatic atmosphere than the X-ray weighted gas. The SZ/X-ray temperature ratio increases with radius, a result we find to be insensitive to variations in baryonic physics, cosmology and numerical resolution.\n",

This process can lead to the formation of hyper-compact star clusters, potentially hosting black holes in the mass range of $10^4$ to $10^5$ solar masses. These clusters are crucial targets for identifying and investigating intermediate-mass black holes. However, no hyper-compact star clusters in the Milky Way have been identified so far. In this paper, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution power of Gaia, we used data from Gaia EDR3 and LAMOST DR7, along with additional data from Pan-STARRS and SDSS, to conduct an initial screening of 6,138,049 sources using various parameters of Gaia EDR3. A total of 4,786 sources were selected for in-depth analysis. Each of these sources was meticulously scrutinized by examining their images, spectra, and nearby celestial objects to exclude various false positives, such as contaminations, galaxies, wide binaries, or wrong matches.

We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNi), considering both gas dynamical friction from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for gas and stellar dynamical friction. We perform extensive simulations of Hill's problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).\n",

      "  - Microlensing near macro-caustics is a complex phenomenon in which swarms of micro-images produced by micro-caustics form on both sides of a macro-critical curve. Recent discoveries of highly magnified images of individual stars in massive galaxy cluster lenses, predicted to be formed by these micro-image swarms, have stimulated studies on this topic. In this Chapter, we explore microlensing near macro-caustics using both simulations and analytic calculations. We show that the mean total magnification of the micro-image swarms follows that of an extended source in the absence of microlensing. Micro-caustics join into a connected network in a region around the macro-critical line of a width proportional to the surface density of microlenses; within this region, the increase of the mean magnification toward the macro-caustic is driven by the increase of the number of micro-images rather than individual magnifications of micro-images. The maximum achievable magnification in micro-caustic crossings decreases with the mass fraction in microlenses. We conclude with a review of applications of this microlensing phenomenon, including limits to the fraction of dark matter in compact objects, and searches of Population III stars and dark matter subhalos. We argue that the discovered highly magnified stars at cosmological distances already imply that less than $\\sim$ 10\\% of the dark matter may be in the form of compact objects with mass above $\\sim 10^{-6}\\, M_{\\odot}$.\n",

If they are indeed interacting gravitationally, this strong starburst could be the hallmark of gas that has been disrupted by an initial close passage. In contrast, the host galaxy of the recently discovered triply-imaged SN H0pe has a much lower SFR than the DSFGs, and we present evidence for the onset of inside-out quenching and large column densities of dust even in regions of low specific SFR.

Thanks to multi-epoch observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, proper motions for stars within the field of NGC 1783 have been derived, thus allowing accurate cluster membership determination. Here, we report that the younger stars within NGC 1783 indeed belong to the cluster, and their spatial distribution is more extended compared to the bulk of the older stellar population, consistent with previous studies. Through N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed characteristics of the younger stars cannot be explained solely by blue straggler stars in the context of the isolated dynamical evolution of NGC 1783. Instead, accretion of the external, low-mass stellar system can better account for both the inverse spatial concentration and the radial velocity isotropy of the younger stars. We propose that NGC 1783 may have accreted external stars from low-mass stellar systems, resulting in a mixture of external younger stars and blue straggler stars from the older bulk population, thereby accounting for the characteristics of the younger sequence.\n",

Highly magnified individual stars allow various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 when the Universe was half of its current age (dubbed ``the Dragon arc''), using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the time-domain technique. These events are found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses.

We evaluate the potential advantages and drawbacks of incorporating cross-bin correlations in Fisher forecasts for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Our analysis considers the impact of including redshift space distortions (RSD) and magnification in model predictions, as well as systematic uncertainties in photometric redshift distributions (photo-$z$). While auto-correlations alone suffer from a degeneracy between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\\sigma_8$) and galaxy bias parameters, accounting for RSD and magnification in cross-correlations helps break this degeneracy - although more weakly than the degeneracy breaking expected from a combined analysis with other observables. Incorporating cross-bin correlations does not significantly increase sensitivity to photo-$z$ systematics, addressing previous concerns, and self-calibrates photo-$z$ systematics, reducing errors on photo-$z$ nuisance parameters. We suggest that the benefits of including cross-correlations in future photometric galaxy clustering analyses outweigh the risks, but caution that careful evaluation is necessary as more realistic pictures of surveys' precision and systematic error budgets develop.\n",

In this paper, we use an analytical probabilistic approach to study the process for the equal mass case and calculate a probability distribution for the orbital parameters of three-body-formed binaries, as well as their formation rate. For the first time, we give closed-form analytical expressions to the full orbital parameter distribution, accounting for both energy and angular momentum conservation. This calculation relies on the sensitive dependence of the outcomes of three-body scatterings on the initial conditions: here we compute the rate of three-body binaries from ergodic interactions, which allow for an analytical derivation of the distribution of orbital parameters of the binaries thus created. We find that soft binaries are highly favoured in this process and that these binaries have a super-thermal eccentricity distribution, while the few hard three-body binaries have an eccentricity distribution much closer to thermal. The analytical results predict and reproduce simulation results of three-body scattering experiments in the literature well.\n",

      "  - Predicting the 21cm signal from the epoch of reionization and cosmic dawn is a complex and challenging task. Various simplifying assumptions have been applied over the last decades to make the modeling more affordable. In this paper, we investigate the validity of several such assumptions, using a simulation suite consisting of three different astrophysical source models that agree with the current constraints on the reionization history and the UV luminosity function. We first show that the common assumption of a saturated spin temperature may lead to significant errors in the 21cm clustering signal over the full reionization period. The same is true for the assumption of a neutral universe during the cosmic dawn which may lead to significant deviation from the correct signal during the heating and the Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling period. Another popular simplifying assumption consists of predicting the global differential brightness temperature ($dT_b$) based on the average quantities of the reionization fraction, gas temperature, and Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling. We show that such an approach leads to a 10 percent deeper absorption signal compared to the results obtained by averaging the final $dT_b$-map. Finally, we investigate the simplifying method of breaking the 21cm clustering signal into different auto and cross components that are then solved assuming linearity. We show that even though the individual fields have a variance well below unity, they often cannot be treated perturbatively as the perturbations are strongly non-Gaussian. As a consequence, predictions based on the perturbative solution of individual auto and cross power spectra may lead to strongly biased results, even if higher-order terms are taken into account.\n",

      "  - Observations of caustic-crossing galaxies at redshift $0.7<z<1$ show a wealth of transient events. Most of them are believed to be microlensing events of highly magnified stars. Earlier work predicted such events should be common near the critical curves (CCs) of galaxy clusters, but some are found relatively far away from these CCs. We consider the possibility that substructure on milliarcsecond scales (few parsecs in the lens plane) is boosting the microlensing signal. We study the combined magnification from the macrolens, millilenses, and microlenses (3M-lensing). After considering realistic populations of millilenses and microlenses, we conclude that the enhanced microlensing rate around millilenses is not sufficient to explain the high fraction of observed events in the far region. Instead we find a that the shape of the luminosity function (LF) of the lensed stars combined with the amount of substructure in the lens plane determines the number of mcirolensing events found near and far from the CC. By measuring $\\beta$ (the exponent of the LF), and the number density of microlensing events at each location, one can create a pseudoimage of the underlying distribution of mass on small scales. We identify two regimes: (i) positive imaging regime where $\\beta>2$ and the number density of events is greater around substructureand the number density of events is greater around substructures, and (ii) negative imaging regime where $\\beta<2$. We study the particular case of seven microlensing events found by HST in the Dragon arc (at z=0.725). We find that a population of supergiant stars with a steep LF with $\\beta=2.55$ fits the distribution of these events. We identify a small region of high density of microlensing events, and interpret it as evidence of a possible invisible substructure, for which we derive a mass of $\\sim 1.3 \\times 10^8\\,\\Msun$ (within its Einstein radius).\n",

Systematic errors in lensing signals by galaxy clusters can be empirically estimated by comparing different surveys with independent and uncorrelated systematics. To assess the robustness of the lensing results to systematic errors, we carried out end-to-end tests across different data sets. We performed a unified analysis at the catalogue level by leveraging the Euclid combined cluster and weak-lensing pipeline (COMB-CL). COMB-CL will measure weak lensing cluster masses for the Euclid Survey. Heterogeneous data sets from five independent, recent, lensing surveys (CHFTLenS, DES~SV1, HSC-SSP~S16a, KiDS~DR4, and RCSLenS), which exploited different shear and photometric redshift estimation algorithms, were analysed with a consistent pipeline under the same model assumptions. We performed a comparison of the amplitude of the reduced excess surface density and of the mass estimates using lenses from the Planck PSZ2 and SDSS redMaPPer cluster samples. Mass estimates agree with literature results collected in the LC2 catalogues. Mass accuracy was further investigated considering the AMICO detected clusters in the HSC-SSP XXL North field. The consistency of the data sets was tested using our unified analysis framework. We found agreement between independent surveys, at the level of systematic noise in Stage-III surveys or precursors. This indicates successful control over systematics. If such control continues in Stage-IV, Euclid will be able to measure the weak lensing masses of around 13000 (considering shot noise only) or 3000 (noise from shape and large-scale-structure) massive clusters with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3.\n",

Inspired by the latest insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we found that synchrotron emission's intensity structures inherently reflect this anisotropy, providing crucial information to aid in 3D magnetic field studies: (i) the structure's elongation gives the magnetic field's POS orientation and (ii) the structure's anisotropy degree and topology reveal the inclination angle and magnetization. Capitalizing on this foundation, we integrate a machine learning approach-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-to extract this latent information, thereby facilitating the exploration of 3D magnetic fields. The model is trained on synthetic synchrotron emission maps, derived from 3D MHD turbulence simulations encompassing a range of sub-Alfv\\'enic to super-Alfv\\'enic conditions.

This renders the method particularly suitable for application to interferometric data lacking single-dish measurements.

It is thus important to study a large number of HFSs using both intensity and velocity information to constrain these objects better observationally. We present here a study of the hub-filament system associated with G6.55-0.1 using newly obtained observations of radio continuum and $J$=2--1 transition of CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. The radio continuum maps show multiple peaks that coincide with far-infrared dust continuum peaks indicating the presence of more than one young massive stars in the hub of the HFS. We used the velocity information from the C$^{18}$O(2--1) map to (a) show that the source G6.55-0.1 is not physically associated with the SNR W28 and (b) disentangle and identify the velocity components genuinely associated with G6.55-0.1. Among the velocity-coherent structures identified, the two filaments at 13.8 and 17.3 km s$^{-1}$ contribute a total mass accretion rate of $\\sim$3000 M$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ to the hub. Both the filaments also show V-shaped structure, characteristic of gravitational collapse, in their velocity profile at the location of the hub. Estimated mass per unit length of the segments of the filaments are smaller than the critical line masses derived from virial equilibrium considerations. This suggests that while the filaments are not gravitationally collapsing as a whole, the spectra from the hub indicate that the inner parts are dynamically decoupled and collapsing to form stars.\n",

Our objective is to enhance the network of Si- and S-bearing chemical reactions for a gas-grain model in molecular clouds, encompassing both low and high metallicities. We have calculated the energies and rate coefficients for 6 neutral atom-diatom reactions involved in the SiCS triatomic system, with a special focus on the C+SiS and S+SiC collisions. We employ the coupled cluster method with single and double substitutions and a perturbative treatment of triple substitutions (CCSD(T)) refined at the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12 level. With these computational results in conjunction with data from the literature, we construct an extended network of neutral-neutral chemical reactions. We performed time-dependent models employing the Nautilus gas-grain code, setting the gas temperature to 10 K and the density to 2x10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The temperature dependence for the reactions involving SiS were modelled using $k(T)=\\alpha \\left( T/300 \\right)^{\\beta} \\exp{(-\\gamma/T)}$.

By expanding the gas reaction network using a high metallicity model, we derived estimates for the abundances of interstellar molecules. The inclusion of neutral-neutral mechanisms, particularly via Si+HS and S+SiC channels, played a pivotal role in determining SiS abundance. These mechanisms carry a significance on a par with the well-known and fast ion-neutral reactions.\n",

      "  - The ALMA-IMF Large Program provides multi-tracer observations of 15 Galactic massive protoclusters at matched sensitivity and spatial resolution. We focus on the dense gas kinematics of the G353.41 protocluster traced by N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0), with an spatial resolution $\\sim$0.02 pc. G353.41, at a distance of $\\sim$2 kpc, has a mass of $\\sim$2500 M$_{\\odot}$ within $1.3\\times1.3$ pc$^2$. We extract the N$_2$H$^+$ isolated line component and we decompose it by fitting up to 3 Gaussian velocity components. This allows us to identify velocity structures that are impossible to identify in the traditional position-velocity diagram. We identify multiple velocity gradients on large ($\\sim$1 pc) and small scales ($\\sim$0.2 pc). We find good agreement between the N$_2$H$^+$ velocities and the previously reported DCN core velocities, suggesting that cores are kinematically coupled to the dense gas in which they form. We measure 9 converging ``V-shaped'' velocity gradients ($\\sim20$ km/s/pc), located in filaments, which are sometimes associated with cores near their point of convergence. The average inflow timescale is $\\sim67$ kyr, or about twice the free-fall time of cores in the same area ($\\sim33$ kyr) but substantially shorter than protostar lifetime estimates ($\\sim$0.5 Myr). We derive mass accretion rates in the range of $(0.35-8.77)\\,\\times\\,10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr. This feeding might lead to further filament collapse and formation of new cores. We suggest that the protocluster is collapsing on large scales, but the velocity signature of collapse is slow compared to pure free-fall. These data are consistent with a comparatively slow global protocluster contraction under gravity, and faster core formation within, suggesting the formation of multiple generations of stars over the protocluster lifetime.\n",

A particularly important epoch in the growth of galaxies is near $z \\sim 2$ often referred to as `cosmic noon', where galaxies on average reach the peak of their star formation. We study a population of 125 cluster galaxies at $z \\sim 1.6$ in three Hubble Space Telescope (HST) filters, F475W, F625W, and F160W, roughly corresponding to the rest-frame FUV, NUV, and r band, respectively. By comparing to a control sample of 200 field galaxies at similar redshift, we reveal clear, statistically significant differences in the overall spatially resolved colors and color gradients in galaxies across these two different environments. On average, cluster galaxies have redder UV colors in both the inner and outer regions bounded by $r_{\\mathrm{50}}$, as well as an overall wider dispersion of outside-in color gradients. The presence of these observed differences, along with evidence from ancillary data from previous studies, strongly suggests that the environment drives these population-level color differences, by affecting the stellar populations and/or dust content.\n",

      "  - We explore the impact of dynamical friction on scales where the linear growth factor and the spherical collapse model can be applied and show its influence on the evolution of perturbations. In particular, considering smooth and clustering dark energy models, we describe the role played by friction by selecting two main hierarchical models, i.e., the first where the friction term is proportional to the Hubble rate, whereas the second where friction is induced by the dark energy pressure. The second approach generalises the first and translates the idea that pressure is a general relativistic effect, motivating why friction might arise once barotropic dark energy fluids are considered. The corresponding effects of friction are investigated at the level of linear and nonlinear perturbations, using the formalism of the spherical collapse model. Whilst dynamical friction has very small effects and thus it cannot be excluded a priori, dissipative pressure friction leads to a substantial slow down in the evolution of perturbations. This can be inferred particularly from the halo mass function, for which we also employ corrections due to dark energy clustering. To this end, in order to discern detectable deviations from the standard cosmological model, we thus highlight where dissipation effects might play a significant role at large scales.\n",

However, obtaining such constraints requires special care in validating the methodology and efforts to reduce the computational time required through data compression and emulation techniques. In this work, we perform a rigorous validation of the PyBird power spectrum modelling code with both a traditional emulated Full-Modelling approach and the model-independent ShapeFit compression approach. By using cubic box simulations that accurately reproduce the clustering and precision of the DESI survey, we find that the cosmological constraints from ShapeFit and Full-Modelling are consistent with each other at the $\\sim0.5\\sigma$ level for the $\\Lambda$CDM model.

In this work, we study the robustness of the theoretical modelling of the power spectrum of FOLPS, a novel effective field theory-based package for evaluating the redshift space power spectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos. We perform this validation by fitting the AbacusSummit high-accuracy $N$-body simulations for Luminous Red Galaxies, Emission Line Galaxies and Quasar tracers, calibrated to describe DESI observations. We quantify the potential systematic error budget of FOLPS, finding that the modelling errors are fully sub-dominant for the DESI statistical precision within the studied range of scales. Additionally, we study two complementary approaches to fit and analyse the power spectrum data, one based on direct Full-Modelling fits and the other on the ShapeFit compression variables, both resulting in very good agreement in precision and accuracy. In each of these approaches, we study a set of potential systematic errors induced by several assumptions, such as the choice of template cosmology, the effect of prior choice in the nuisance parameters of the model, or the range of scales used in the analysis. Furthermore, we show how opening up the parameter space beyond the vanilla $\\Lambda$CDM model affects the DESI observables. These studies include the addition of massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, and dark energy equation of state.

We identify 94 dense cores using a dendrogram analysis of the NH$_3$ (1,1) integrated intensity. Gas temperatures $T_K$ and non-thermal linewidths $\\sigma_\\mathrm{NT}$ both increase towards the centre of the young stellar cluster, in the dense gas generally and in the cores specifically. We find that most cores (54\\%) are super-virial, with gravitationally bound cores located primarily in the filaments.

In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask, weighting scheme, and presence of holes in the window function. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general \"unwindowed'' estimators and idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $<10$ for bispectra).

All the models are analyzed at the same age of 13 Gyr, when they have reached different evolutionary phases. The sample of models is well representative of the structural properties of the observed population of Galactic globular clusters. We confirm that the three nCRD parameters are powerful tools to distinguish systems in early stages of dynamical evolution, from those that already experienced core collapse. They might also help disentangle clusters hosting a low-mass intermediate-mass black hole of a few hundred solar masses, from cases with large concentrations of dark remnants in their centers. With respect to other dynamical indicators, the nCRD parameters offer the advantage of being fully empirical and easier to measure from observational data.\n",

To this end, we consider various well-known parametrizations of the DE equation of state (EoS) and consider perturbations in both the dark sectors, along with an interaction term. Moreover, we perform a separate study for the phantom and non-phantom regimes. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae data sets, constraints on the model parameters for each case have been obtained and a generic reduction in the $H_0-\\sigma_{8,0}$ correlation has been observed, both for constant and dynamical DE EoS. This reduction, coupled with a significant negative correlation between the interaction term and $\\sigma_{8,0}$, contributes to easing the clustering tension by lowering $\\sigma_{8,0}$ to somewhere in between the early CMB and late-time clustering measurements for the phantom regime, for almost all the models under consideration. Additionally, this is achieved without exacerbating the Hubble tension.

However, for the non-phantom regime the $\\sigma_{8,0}$ tension tends to have worsened, which reassures the merits of phantom DE from latest data.

We find that GMC gas is important in facilitating the growth of clusters in their embedded phase by promoting cluster mergers. Mergers induce asymmetric expansion of the stellar component of the clusters in our simulations. As well, mergers induce angular momentum in the clusters' stellar and gas components. We find that mergers can lead to an increase in the amount of dense gas present in clusters if a background gas distribution is present. We predict that this can lead to new star formation that can change the overall distribution of cluster stars in velocity space.

We present analytic expressions for the correlation function of fast radio bursts (FRBs), and for the galaxy-FRB cross-correlation function, in the presence of these dispersion measure-space distortions. We find that the even multipoles of these correlations are primarily dominated by non-local contributions (e.g. the electron density fluctuations integrated along the line of sight), while the dipole also receives a significant contribution from the Doppler effect, one of the major relativistic effects.

      "  - When falling into a galaxy cluster, galaxies experience a loss of gas due to ram pressure stripping. In particular, disk galaxies lose gas from their disks and very large tentacles of gas can be formed. Because of the morphology of these stripped galaxies they have been referred to as Jellyfish galaxies. It has been found that star formation is triggered not only in the disk, but also in the tentacles of such Jellyfish galaxies. The observed star forming regions located in the tentacles of those galaxies have been found to be as massive as $3\\times10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ and with sizes $> 100$ pc. Interestingly, these parameters in mass and size agree with those of dwarf galaxies. In this work we make use of the state of the art magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris TNG-50, to study massive jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles. We find that, in the tentacles of TNG-50 Jellyfish galaxies, the star formation regions (gas+stars) formed could be as massive as $\\sim2\\times10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$. A particular star forming region was analyzed. This region has a star formation rate of $0.04$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr, it is metal rich, has an average age of $0.46$ Gyr, and has a half mass radius of $\\sim1$ kpc, typical of standard dwarf galaxies.

      "  - While pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, its origin is still unclear. If this background is of astrophysical origin, we expect the distribution of GW sources to follow the one of galaxies. Since galaxies are not perfectly isotropically distributed at large scales, but follow the cosmological large-scale structure, this would lead to an intrinsic anisotropy in the distribution of GW sources. In this work, we develop a formalism to account for this anisotropy, by considering a Gaussian ensemble of sources in each realization of the universe and then taking ensemble averages over all such realizations. We find that large-scale galaxy clustering has no impact on the expectation value of pulsar timing residual correlations, described by the Hellings-Downs curve. However, it introduces a new contribution to the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation. Hence, the anisotropic distribution of sources contributes to the amount by which the measurements of pulsar timing residual correlations, in our single realization of the universe, may differ from the Hellings-Downs curve.\n",

However, dedicated searches, especially in infrared and radio wavelengths, have returned mostly upper limits, which are lower than theoretical expectations by several orders of magnitude. We profited from recent wide-field photometry for 48 Galactic globular clusters to compute high-resolution maps of differential reddening, which can be used to correct any photometric catalog in these areas for reddening variations. Using 3D reddening maps from the literature, we evaluated the amount of foreground extinction. This allowed us to estimate the masses of the intracluster medium in our sample clusters, with an accuracy of one order of magnitude. Our estimates agree with the few available literature detections and with theoretical expectations. Because the discrepancy between observations and expectations only concerns literature upper limits, we explored possible reasons why they could be underestimated and we show that two recent discoveries can explain the discrepancy. The first is the recent discovery that the intracluster medium in 47 Tuc is not centrally concentrated. This is also supported by our maps, which in the majority of cases do not show a central reddening concentration. The second is the discovery that the dust in metal-poor ([Fe/H] less than about -1 dex) globular clusters is dominated by iron grains rather than silicates, which undermines previous dust mass estimates from observed upper limits. We conclude that current evidence, including our maps, does not contradict theoretical expectations and the problem of the missing intracluster medium is no longer an issue.\n",

      "  - Our main goal is here to make a comparative analysis between the well-known MOND theory and a more recent model called$\\kappa$-model. An additional connection, between the $\\kappa$-model and twoother novel MOND-type theories: Newtonian Fractional-DimensionGravity (NFDG) and Refracted Gravity (RG), is likewise presented.All these models are built to overtake the DM paradigm, or at leastto strongly reduce the dark matter content. Whereas they rely ondifferent formalisms, however, all four seem to suggest that the universal parameter, a0, appearing in MOND theory could intrinsicallybe correlated to either the sole baryonic mean mass density (RG and$\\kappa$-model) and/or to the dimension of the object under consideration(NFDG and $\\kappa$-model). We could then confer to the parameter a0 amore flexible status of multiscale parameter, as required to explainthe dynamics together in galaxies and in galaxy clusters. Eventually,the conformal gravity theory (CFT) also seems to have some remotelink with the $\\kappa$-model, even though the first one is an extension ofgeneral relativity, and the second one is Newtonian in essence. The$\\kappa$-model has been tested on a small sample of spiral galaxies and ingalaxy clusters. Now we test this model on a large sample of galaxiesissued from the SPARC database.\n",

      "  - The main aim of this paper is to study both the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and the young stellar population in the three star-forming regions, namely IRAS 05137+3919, 05168+3634, and 19110+1045. The study of the ISM includes determination of the hydrogen column density (N(H_2)) and dust temperature (T_d) in the regions using Modified blackbody fitting. The main parameters of identified and classified young stellar objects (YSOs) belonging to the regions were determined comparing with the radiation transfer models. We also constructed a colour-magnitude diagram to compare the parameters of the YSOs with the results of the radiative transfer models. The three stellar populations appear to have formed under different scenarios. In the cases of IRAS 05137+3919 and IRAS 05168+3634, the age spread is considerably wider, suggesting that the stellar population likely emerged from independent condensations. In contrast, the third region comprises a pair of ultra-compact HII regions (UCHIIs), G45.12+0.13 and G45.07+0.13, with a notably smaller age spread. This hints at the possibility that these clusters originated from a single triggering event.\n",

Their dark matter component, which amounts to around 80\\% of the total mass, cannot be directly observed but traced by the distribution of diffused gas and galaxy members. In this work, we aim to infer the cluster's projected total mass distribution from mock observational data, i.e. stars, Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and X-ray, by training deep learning models. To this end, we have created a multiview images dataset from {\\sc{The Three Hundred}} simulation that is optimal for training Machine Learning models.

      "  - Empirical constraints on the internal dynamics of open clusters are important for understanding their evolution and evaporation. High precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 are thus useful to observe aspects of the cluster dynamics. This work aims to identify dynamically peculiar clusters such as spinning and expanding clusters. We also quantify the spin frequency and expansion rate and compare them with $N$-body models to identify the origins of the peculiarities. We used the latest Gaia DR3 and archival spectroscopic surveys to analyse the radial velocities and proper motions of the cluster members in 1379 open clusters. A systematic analysis of synthetic clusters is performed to demonstrate the observability of the cluster spin along with effects of observational uncertainties. $N$-body simulations were used to understand the evolution of cluster spin and expansion for initially non-rotating clusters. We identified spin signatures in 10 clusters (and 16 candidates). Additionally, we detected expansion in 18 clusters and contraction in 3 clusters. The expansion rate is compatible with previous theoretical estimates based on expulsion of residual gas. The orientation of the spin axis is independent of the orbital angular momentum. The spin frequencies are much larger than what is expected from simulated initially non-rotating clusters. This indicates that >1% of the clusters are born rotating and/or they have undergone strong interactions. Higher precision observations are required to increase the sample of such dynamically peculiar clusters and to characterise them.\n",

      "  - Conventional studies of galaxy clustering within the framework of halo models typically assume that the density profile of all dark matter haloes can be approximated by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) spherically symmetric profile. However, both modern N-body simulations and observational data suggest that most haloes are either oblate or prolate, and almost never spherical. In this paper we present a modified model of the galaxy correlation function. In addition to the five \"classical\" HOD parameters proposed by Zheng et al. 2007, it includes an additional free parameter $\\phi$ in the modified NFW density profile describing the asymmetry of the host dark matter halo.   Using a subhalo abundance matching model (SHAM), we populate galaxies within BolshoiP N-body simulations. We compute the projected two-point correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ for six stellar mass volume limited galaxy samples. We fit our model to the results, and then compare the best-fit asymmetry parameter $\\phi$ (and other halo parameters) to the asymmetry of dark matter haloes measured directly from the simulations and find that they agree within 1$\\sigma$. We then fit our model to the $w_p(r_p)$ results from Zehavi et al. 2011 and compare halo parameters. We show that our model accurately retrieves the halo asymmetry and other halo parameters. Additionally, we find $2-6\\%$ differences between the halo masses ($\\log M_{min}$ and $\\log M_1$) estimated by our model and \"classical\" HOD models. The model proposed in this paper can serve as an alternative to multiparameter HOD models, since it can be used for relatively small samples of galaxies.\n",

      "  - Methods. We utilized the combined five SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey data (eRASS:5) to perform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses of the Centaurus cluster in various directions to large radii. Surface brightness (SB) profiles out to $2R_{200}$ were constructed. We acquired gas temperature, metallicity, and normalization per area profiles out to $R_{200}$. We compared our results with previous Centaurus studies, cluster outskirts measurements, and simulations. Comprehensive sky background analysis was done across the FoV, in particular, to assess the variation of the eROSITA Bubble emission that partially contaminates the field. Results. The processed X-ray images show the known sloshing-induced structures in the core. The core ($r\\leq11~\\mathrm{kpc}$) is better described with a 2T model than a 1T model. Here, we measured lower T from the cooler component (~1.0 keV) and higher Z ($\\sim\\!1.6Z_\\odot$), signifying an iron bias. In the intermediate radial range, we observed prominent SB and normalization per area excesses in the eastern sector (Cen 45 location), reaching out to $R_{500}$. Temperature enhancements near the location of Cen 45 imply that the gas is shock-heated due to the interaction with Cen 30, the significant excess behind Cen 45 center might be the tail/ram-pressure-stripped gas. We found good agreement between the outskirt temperatures with the profile from simulations and fit from Suzaku outskirts measurements. We detected significant SB emission to the sky background level out to $R_{200}$ with a $3.5\\sigma$ and followed by $2.9\\sigma$ at $1.1R_{200}$. The metallicity at $R_{500}-R_{200}$ is low but within the ranges of other outskirts studies. Conclusions. We present the first measurement of ICM morphology and properties of Centaurus cluster sampling the whole azimuth beyond $30'$, increasing the probed volume by a factor of almost 30.\n",

      "  - We present the results of direct-method metallicity measurements in the disk and outflow of the low-metallicity starburst galaxy NGC 1569. We use Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations to map the galaxy across 54$\\arcsec$ (800 pc) along the major axis and 48$\\arcsec$ (700 pc) along the minor axis with a spatial resolution of 1$\\arcsec$ ($\\sim$15 pc). We detect common strong emission lines ([\\ion{O}{III}] $\\lambda$5007, H$\\beta$, [\\ion{O}{II}] $\\lambda$3727) and the fainter [\\ion{O}{III}] $\\lambda$4363 auroral line, which allows us to measure electron temperature ($T_e$) and metallicity. Theory suggests that outflows drive metals out of the disk driving observed trends between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. Our main result is that the metallicity in the outflow is similar to that of the disk, $Z_{\\rm out} / Z_{\\rm ISM} \\approx 1$. This is consistent with previous absorption line studies in higher mass galaxies. Assumption of a mass-loading factor of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}/{\\rm SFR}\\sim3$ makes the metal-loading of NGC 1569 consistent with expectations derived from the mass-metallicity relationship. Our high spatial resolution metallicity maps reveal a region around a supermassive star cluster (SSC-B) with distinctly higher metallicity and higher electron density, compared to the disk. Given the known properties of SSC-B the higher metallicity and density of this region are likely the result of star formation-driven feedback acting on the local scale. Overall, our results are consistent with the picture in which metal-enriched winds pollute the circumgalactic medium surrounding galaxies, and thus connect the small-scale feedback processes to large-scale properties of galaxy halos.\n",

We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly-identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources, and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free-free emission. We use measurements of free-free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values $\\sim10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured towards proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster, but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially-extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external UV fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster, but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.\n",

During a 25 day flight OLIMPO will image a total of 10 z~0.05 galaxy clusters and 8 bridges at 145, 250, 365, and 460 GHz at an angular resolution of 1.0'-3.3'. The maps will be significantly deeper than those planned from CMB-S4 and CCAT-P, and will have excellent fidelity to the large angular scales of our low-z targets, which are difficult to probe from the ground. In combination with X-ray data from eROSITA and XRISM we will transform our current static view of galaxy clusters into a full dynamic picture by measuring the internal intra-cluster medium (ICM) velocity structure with the kinematic SZE, X-ray spectroscopy, and the power spectrum of ICM fluctuations. Radio observations from ASKAP and MeerKAT will be used to better understand the connection between ICM turbulence and shocks with the relativistic plasma. Beyond the cluster boundary, we will combine thermal SZE maps from OLIMPO with X-ray imaging from eROSITA to measure the thermodynamics of the WHIM residing in filaments, providing a better understanding of its properties and its contribution to the total baryon budget.\n",

To date, most studies have focused on mergers occurring in the plane of the sky, where morphological features can be readily identified. To allow study of mergers with arbitrary orientation, we have assembled multi-probe data for the eight-cluster ICM-SHOX sample sensitive to both morphology and line of sight velocity. The first ICM-SHOX paper (Silich+2023) provided an overview of our methodology applied to one member of the sample, MACS J0018.5+1626, in order to constrain its merger geometry. That work resulted in an exciting new discovery of a velocity space decoupling of its gas and dark matter distributions. In this work, we describe the availability and quality of multi-probe data for the full ICM-SHOX galaxy cluster sample. These datasets will form the observational basis of an upcoming full ICM-SHOX galaxy cluster sample analysis.\n",

With the advancement of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) studies and surveys relative to X-ray observations, we seek to investigate surface brightness fluctuations in a sample of SPT-SZ clusters which also have archival \\textit{XMM-Newton} data. Here we present a pilot study of two typical clusters in that sample: SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and SPT-CLJ0638-5358.
