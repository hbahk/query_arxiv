      "  - The Cosmological Principle posits that the Universe is isotropic on the largest scales. While widely supported, this foundational assumption remains testable. We analyse the angular distribution of over one million quasars from the Gaia-unWISE catalogue using Renyi entropy, a multiscale statistical measure sensitive to higher-order clustering. Dividing the sample into three redshift bins, we find that both the low- and high-redshift distributions are statistically consistent with isotropy. However, at intermediate redshift ($1 \\leq z < 2.2$), we detect a statistically significant and scale-dependent anisotropy that persists under stringent masking, suggesting a physical origin. We interpret this as evidence for a transitional epoch in cosmic history, during which large-scale structures such as superclusters became prominent before their growth was gradually damped by the onset of accelerated expansion. These findings position Renyi entropy as a powerful probe of cosmic evolution and highlight the potential thermodynamic links between structure formation, entropy dissipation, and the emergence of large-scale isotropy.\n",

      "  - We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in AMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts for the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost through non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the interstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples with the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions, increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure within HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution. Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three orders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution, impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young star clusters.\n",

      "  - Galaxies moving through the gas of the intracluster medium (ICM) experience ram pressure stripping, which can leave behind a gas tail. When a disk galaxy receives the wind edge-on, however, the characteristic signature is not a typical jellyfish tail, but rather an unwinding of the spiral arms. We aim to quantify such asymmetries both in the gas and in the stellar component of a simulated galaxy. To this end, we simulate a gas-rich star-forming spiral galaxy moving through a self-consistent ICM gas. The amplitude and location of the asymmetries were measured via Fourier decomposition. We found that the asymmetry is much more evident in the gas component, but it is also measurable in the stars. The amplitude tends to increase with time and the asymmetry radius migrates inwards. We found that, when considering the gas, the spiral arms extend much further and are more unwound than the corresponding stellar arms. Characterizing the unwinding via simulations should help inform the observational criteria used to classify ram pressure stripped galaxies, as opposed to asymmetries induced by other mechanisms.\n",

      "  - Context. Galaxies fly inside galaxy clusters and ram pressure by the ICM can remove a large amount of the ISM from the galaxy, and deposit the gas in the ICM. The ISM decoupled from the host galaxy leaves a long trail following the moving galaxy. Such long trails track the galaxy motion and can be detected with sensitive data in Halpha.   Aims. We study the Halpha tail trailing NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster.   Methods. The initial discovery was made with the deep Halpha imaging data with CFHT, from the VESTIGE project. The follow-up spectroscopic observations were made with APO/DIS, MMT/Binospec and CFHT/SITELLE.   Results. Besides the known 80 kpc Halpha tail downstream of NGC 4569, the deep Halpha imaging data allow the Halpha tail detected to at least 230 kpc from the galaxy. More importantly, the Halpha clumps implied from the imaging data are confirmed with the spectroscopic data. The Halpha clumps show a smooth radial velocity gradient across about 1300 km/s, eventually reaching the velocity of the cluster. We build a simple model to explain the deceleration of stripped clumps and constrain the age to about 0.9 Gyr.   Conclusions. This discovery, for the first time, demonstrates the full deceleration process of the stripped ISM. This discovery also showcases the potential with wide-field Halpha survey on galaxy clusters to discover intracluster optical emission-line clouds originated from cluster galaxies. These clouds provide kinematic tracers to the infall history of cluster galaxies and the turbulence in the ICM. They are also excellent multi-phase objects to study the relevant important physical processes.\n",

      "  - We investigate the clustering of Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts of 3 $\\lesssim z \\lesssim$ 5 within the COSMOS field by measuring the angular two-point correlation function. Our robust sample of $\\sim$60,000 bright ($m_{\\rm UV}\\lesssim 27$) Lyman-break galaxies was selected based on spectral energy distribution fitting across 14 photometric bands spanning optical and near-infrared wavelengths. We constrained both the 1- and 2-halo terms at separations up to 300 arcsec, finding an excess in the correlation function at scales corresponding to $<20$ kpc, consistent with enhancement due to clumps in the same galaxy or interactions on this scale. We then performed Bayesian model fits on the correlation functions to infer the Halo Occupation Distribution parameters, star formation duty cycle, and galaxy bias in three redshift bins. We examined several cases where different combinations of parameters were varied, showing that our data can constrain the slope of the satellite occupation function, which previous studies have fixed. For an $M_{\\rm{UV}}$-limited sub-sample, we found galaxy bias values of $b_g=3.18^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ at $z\\simeq3$, $b_g=3.58^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ at $z\\simeq4$, $b_g=4.27^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ at $z\\simeq5$. The duty cycle values are $0.62^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$, $0.40^{+0.34}_{-0.22}$, and $0.39^{+0.31}_{-0.20}$, respectively. These results suggest that, as the redshift increases, there is a slight decrease in the host halo masses and a shorter timescale for star formation in bright galaxies, at a fixed rest-frame UV luminosity threshold.\n",

      "  - We present a robust, apples-to-apples comparison between the photometric properties of the intracluster light (ICL) in the TNG300 magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulation and those in Wendelstein Wide Field Imager (WWFI) observations. This is accomplished by generating synthetic $g'$-band images of 40 massive ($\\log\\left(M_{\\rm 200, crit}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\right) > 14.5$) TNG300 clusters at $z \\approx 0.06$, closely mimicking WWFI observations, and then performing identical photometric calculations on the synthetic and real images. Importantly, we apply the same observationally motivated satellite-masking procedure to both data-sets, which effectively removes any possible biases introduced by the halo finder. We first analyze the light distribution of the `smooth' stellar component of each cluster, composed of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) plus the ICL, and find that it tends to be about twice as extended in TNG300 than in observations, while also being approximately 1 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ brighter. We then quantify $f_{\\rm ICL}$, the ICL fraction relative to the BCG+ICL, by considering several ICL definitions: (i) the light dimmer than a surface brightness cut at 27 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, (ii) the excess light over a de Vaucouleurs profile, (iii) the light beyond twice the half-light radius ($2 r_{\\rm half}$), and (iv) the light beyond a fixed circular aperture of 30, 50, or 100 kpc. For most definitions, the median $f_{\\rm ICL}$ is consistent between simulation and observations. However, the observations exhibit larger scatter in $f_{\\rm ICL}$, which we attribute primarily to observational uncertainties in the total BCG+ICL luminosity rather than `true' cluster-to-cluster variation in the real Universe. We also find that most methods yield median $f_{\\rm ICL}$ values near 0.3, which is consistent with a BCG/ICL transition radius around $2 r_{\\rm half}$.\n",

      "  - The vast amount of energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\\odot$ black hole seeds with their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of $\\sim10^7 M_\\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding 2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black holes, dynamical masses of $\\sim10^{9.5} M_\\odot$, and high, though short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.\n",

      "  - The XRISM Resolve X-ray spectrometer allows to gain detailed insight into gas motions of the intra cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Current simulation studies focus mainly on statistical comparisons, making the comparison to the currently still small number of clusters difficult due to unknown selection effects. This study aims to bridge this gap, using simulated counterparts of Coma, Virgo, and Perseus from the SLOW constrained simulations. These clusters show excellent agreement in their properties and dynamical state with observations, thus providing an ideal testbed to understand the processes shaping the properties of the ICM. We find that the simulations match the order of the amount of turbulence for the three considered clusters, Coma being the most active, followed by Perseus, while Virgo is very relaxed. Typical turbulent velocities are a few $\\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, very close to observed values. The resulting turbulent pressure support is $\\approx1\\%$ for Virgo and $\\approx 3-4\\%$ for Perseus and Coma within the central $1-2\\%$ of $R_{200}$. Compared to previous simulations and observations, measured velocities and turbulent pressure support are consistently lower, in line with XRISM findings, thus indicating the importance of selection effects.\n",

The galaxy is clumpy and blue, and appears to host globular clusters (GCs), suggesting a distance of ~50-60 Mpc which would make the dwarf an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG). We carry out spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, in order to estimate the galaxy age and metallicity. We infer a recent peak of star formation that may have led to the formation of the UDG through feedback-driven expansion.

      "  - Assuming a minimal $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM value ($\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\\sum m_\\nu \\gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\\sim 2\\sigma$.

      "  - Galaxy clusters, the pinnacle of structure formation in our universe, are a powerful cosmological probe. Several approaches have been proposed to express cluster number counts, but all these methods rely on empirical explicit scaling relations that link observed properties to the total cluster mass. These scaling relations are over-parametrised, inducing some degeneracy with cosmology. Moreover, they do not provide a direct handle on the numerous non-gravitational phenomena that affect the physics of the intra-cluster medium. We present a proof-of-concept to model cluster number counts, that bypasses the explicit use of scaling relations. We rather implement the effect of several astrophysical processes to describe the cluster properties. We then evaluate the performances of this modelling for the cosmological inference. We developed an accelerated machine learning baryonic field-emulator, built upon the Lagrangian Deep Learning method and trained on the CAMELS simulations. We then created a pipeline that simulates cluster counts in terms of XMM observable quantities. We finally compare the performances of our model, with that involving scaling relations, for the purpose of cosmological inference based on simulations. Our model correctly reproduces the cluster population from the calibration simulations at the fiducial parameter values, and allows us to constrain feedback mechanisms. The cosmological-inference analyses indicate that our simulation-based model is less degenerate than the approach using scaling relations. This novel approach to model observed cluster number counts from simulations opens interesting perspectives for cluster cosmology. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of the standard approach, provided that the resolution and the volume of the simulations will allow a most realistic implementation of the complex phenomena driving cluster evolution.\n",

      "  - We present the first cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using extended SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAMe). We analyse stellar mass-selected Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxy clustering and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) galaxy-galaxy lensing and find constraints on $S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3}=0.793^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, in agreement with Planck at 1.7$\\sigma$, and consistent with previous results.

We validate our methodology by first applying it to simulated catalogues, generated from the TNG300 simulation, which mimic the stellar mass selection of our real data. We show that we are able to recover the input cosmology for both our fiducial and all-scale analyses. Our all-scale analysis extends to scales of galaxy-galaxy lensing below $r_\\mathrm{p}<1.4\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$, which we exclude in our fiducial analysis to avoid baryonic effects.

      "  - The aim of this work is to construct mock galaxy catalogues that accurately reproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering statistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy sample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which follows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of $8\\,h^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r<19.5$) galaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and luminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\\rm r}\\leq 20$). Furthermore, we analyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each tracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately reproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\\% agreement for separations of $1<r<20\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\\% for $0.1<r<1\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$.

      "  - The orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A* provides a unique opportunity to test general relativity and study dynamical processes near a supermassive black hole. Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a Schwarzschild orbit at a 10$\\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount of extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\\odot$, under the assumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work we investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass distribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects surrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full N-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2 with different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that granularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a smooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of the in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a sort of \"Brownian motion\" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that these effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from a Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter passage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the astrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\\mu as$, as it happens in 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\\odot$. This presents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects on the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable precision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to constrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly account for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.\n",

      "  - If 0.1% of the dark matter in the Coma cluster is constituted by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-19 to 10^-17 solar masses, then the observed GeV {\\gamma}-ray emission from the cluster could potentially be attributed to Hawking radiation. The emitted spectrum is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, meaning lighter PBHs radiate at higher energies, potentially falling within the GeV range. If 0.1% of the Coma cluster's dark matter is PBH in this mass range, a fit to the cluster's GeV emission is obtained. We then investigate the potential for constraining evaporating PBHs through cross-correlations between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and weak gravitational lensing. Utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations and weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, we assess whether such correlations can reveal a PBH {\\gamma}-ray component. While a statistically significant correlation between the UGRB and large-scale structure has been observed, this signal is consistent with emission from clustered astrophysical sources such as blazars. Attributing a measurable fraction of the UGRB to PBH evaporation would require unrealistically large PBH abundances. We also draw attention to a cluster of Coma-like X-ray clusters, designated Draco X, observed at a redshift of z = 0.12. These systems, characterized by their significant X-ray emission from hot, diffuse intracluster gas, represent massive gravitationally bound structures. The existence and properties of such clusters at these redshifts provide crucial cosmological probes, offering insights into the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and the underlying cosmological parameters. Further investigation of Draco X and similar high-redshift clusters would yield additional constraints on large scale structure.\n",

We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and weak lensing cosmology using SDSS data as the tracer of dark matter (lens sample) and the HSC Y3 dataset as source galaxies. The analysis divides HSC Y3 galaxies into four tomographic bins for both galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear measurements, and employs a point-mass correction model to utilize galaxy-galaxy lensing signals down to 2$h^{-1}$Mpc, extending up to 70$h^{-1}$Mpc. These strategies enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy-galaxy lensing data vector. Using a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8 = 0.780^{+0.029}_{-0.030}$, and using a $w$CDM model, we obtain $S_8 = 0.756^{+0.038}_{-0.036}$ with $w = -1.176^{+0.310}_{-0.346}$.

We present the measurement of the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signals using the SDSS DR11 spectroscopic galaxies as lens galaxies, and the HSC Y3 shear catalog as source galaxies, binned into four tomographic bins by their photometric redshift. The SDSS DR11 galaxies, with a redshift range $0.15<z<0.7$, are binned into three redshift bins, each as a probe for measuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(R_p)$. We measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal $\\Delta \\Sigma (R_p)$ in 12 lens-source bin pairs and show that there is no evidence for significant systematic biases in the measurement with null testing. We combine our $w_p(R_p)$ and $\\Delta \\Sigma (R_p)$ ($2\\times2$pt) data vectors and perform likelihood inference with a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model.

      "  - Photometric redshifts of the source galaxies are a key source of systematic uncertainty in the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)'s galaxy clustering and weak lensing analysis, i.e., the $3\\times 2$pt analysis. This paper introduces a Fisher forecast code FisherA2Z for the LSST Year 10 (Y10) $3 \\times 2$pt and cosmic shear analyses, utilizing a 15-parameter redshift distribution model, with one redshift bias, variance, and outlier rate per tomographic bin. FisherA2Z employs the Core Cosmology Library CCL to compute the large-scale structure power spectrum and incorporates a four-parameter nonlinear alignment model for intrinsic alignments. We evaluate the impact of marginalizing over redshift distribution parameters on weak lensing, forecast biases in cosmological parameters due to redshift errors, and assess cosmological parameter sensitivity to redshift systematic parameters using decision trees. The sensitivity study reveals that for LSST $3\\times2$pt analysis, $S_8$ is most sensitive to the mean redshift of the fourth out of the five source tomographic bins, while other cosmological parameters possess different sensitivities. Additionally, we provide cosmological analysis forecasts based on different scenarios of spectroscopic training datasets. We find that the figures-of-merit for the cosmological results increase with the number of spectroscopic training galaxies, and with the completeness of the training set above $z=1.6$, assuming the redshift information comes solely from the training set galaxies without other external constraints.\n",

The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands (ugriy). We address challenges of crowding near the cluster core and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.\n",

      "  - Cosmic reionization marks a critical epoch when the first galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium through the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation. Young, massive star clusters are believed to be the primary LyC sources, yet the physical mechanisms enabling LyC escape remain poorly understood. Most existing studies rely on spatially integrated observations, which lack the resolution to resolve internal galaxy structure and pinpoint where and how LyC photons escape. To address this, we propose a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that enables spatially resolved spectroscopy of LyC-emitting star clusters and their environments in low-redshift galaxies. This requires a UV integral field unit (IFU) with coverage down to ~ 900 Angstrom and a spatial resolution of 10-100 pc-capabilities essential for directly detecting LyC escape and mapping the surrounding interstellar medium. With such instrumentation, we will map cluster-scale LyC escape fractions, characterize the physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium, and directly observe feedback-driven outflows that facilitate LyC leakage. These observations will enable novel calibrations of indirect LyC indicators at unprecedented spatial resolution and establish direct connections between local LyC processes and those in high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. In the long run, this program will build the physical framework needed to understand how galaxies reionized the early universe and shaped its subsequent evolution.\n",

In this paper, we quantify the amount and evolution of this substructure in simulations of star cluster formation that include radiation magnetohydrodynamical evolution of the gas, coupled with detailed stellar dynamics, binary formation and evolution, and stellar feedback. We find that both spatial and kinematic substructure are present at early times. Both are erased as the cluster assembles through the formation of new stars as well as the merger of sub-clusters. Spatial substructure is erased over a timescale of approximately 2.5 times the initial free-fall time of the cloud. Kinematic substructure persists for longer, and is still present to the end of our simulations.

However, we still do not know the physical mechanisms behind its formation, and whether they will be long-lived objects or whether their mass could destroy them in time. We aim to investigate the formation and evolution of these galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical state-of-the-art simulation IllustrisTNG-100.

We studied the color, merging history, AGN history, and environment in which these galaxies reside. Supermassive disk galaxies typically experience a quiescent merging history, with $48\\%$ experiencing no significant mergers at $z \\leq 1$. Their stellar mass growth is driven mainly by star formation, unlike spheroidal galaxies, which require a significant number of mergers to form. Moreover, the mergers experienced by disk galaxies are generally rich in gas content, irrespective of whether they are minor or major events. Supermassive disks exist across various environments, from isolation to clusters, with $\\sim 60\\%$ inhabiting in isolation or low-mass groups, $\\sim 25\\%$ residing in massive groups, and $\\sim15\\%$ residing within galaxy clusters.

In this work, we present novel MeerKAT observations for a sample of 21 galaxy clusters being part of the CHEX-MATE project. These systems were selected based on their high mass and displaying signs of dynamical activity. Thanks to the high-quality data in hand, we detect extended radio emission in every target considered. We report two new halos, three new relics and confirm a previous candidate halo and two candidate radio relics. When investigating the scaling relations with the cluster properties, we confirm the presence of a radio halo power-mass correlation and relate it to a higher radio halo emissivity in more massive clusters.

Here, we present an analysis of the close binary fraction in a carefully selected sample of field stars and 10 GCs using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) data, which is among the largest samples of GCs analysed using multi-epoch spectroscopy to date. By assessing the peak-to-peak variations of the sources' radial velocity (RV), we estimate the close binary fractions through a method that fits the distribution as the product of two Gaussian distributions. By applying the same RV-variability method to both cluster members and field stars, we ensure a homogeneous and inclusive comparison between the two environments. Despite matching stellar parameters between the field and GC samples, our findings confirm that GCs possess a significantly lower close binary fraction than field stars. Interestingly, we do not detect any clear trend of binary fraction with cluster metallicity; metal-rich and metal-poor GCs are uniformly binary-poor (within uncertainties).

Despite previous observations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the cluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of \\sigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^{-1} in the inner region (~< 25 kpc) and \\sigma_v = 186 +/- 9 km s^{-1} in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT = 5.5 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions, respectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44 +/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to nonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas motion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to the central galaxy (|v_bulk|=8 +/- 7 km s^{-1}), while the outer region exhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk|=104 +/- 7 km s^{-1}. Assuming the velocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate is only ~ 40% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty. This suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not balanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has apparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now be approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum.\n",

In this paper we use EFT-SBP with the galaxy clustering power spectrum and bispectrum data from BOSS in order to test the recent preference for dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. While dynamical dark energy is preferred by the combination of DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, \\textit{Planck} Cosmic Microwave Background, and Pantheon+ supernovae data, we show that this preference disappears once these data sets are combined with the usual BOSS EFT galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum likelihood. The use of the simulation-based priors in this analysis further weakens the case for dynamical dark energy by additionally shrinking the parameter posterior around the cosmological constant region. Specifically, the figure of merit of the dynamical dark energy constraints from the combined data set improves by $\\approx 20\\%$ over the usual EFT-full-shape analysis with the conservative priors. These results are made possible with a novel modeling approach to the EFT prior distribution with the Gaussian mixture models, which allows us to both accurately capture the EFT priors and retain the ability to analytically marginalize the likelihood over most of the EFT nuisance parameters.

Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters.

      "  - Determining stellar ages is challenging, as it depends on other stellar parameters in a non-linear way and often relies on stellar evolution models to infer the underlying relation between these parameters and age. This complexity increases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct indicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the color-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on pre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only cover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion relation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a universal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1) explore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable, extending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and 2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations yield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the same AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective stars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they experience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all giants with metallicity > -0.8 dex and [C/N] < -0.05 dex, and can be used as an age-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\\alpha$ disk.

We investigate the nature and fate of the \"almost dark\" cloud AGC 226178, projected within the Virgo cluster, with an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~1000. We present deep single-dish HI mapping from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), complemented by high-resolution interferometric data from the Very Large Array (VLA), as part of the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. These observations provide the highest-quality HI analysis to date of such a cloud, combining resolution and sensitivity. FAST data reveal a short, low-velocity tail toward the dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, previously proposed as a possible origin for AGC 226178. However, VCC 2034 shows a line-of-sight asymmetric HI feature and cometary morphology indicating a stripping event unrelated to AGC 226178. VLA data reveal a velocity gradient across AGC 226178 and a clumpy internal structure. The velocity dispersion exceeds the thermal linewidth, implying turbulence or unresolved motions. The cloud cannot be gravitationally bound by atomic gas alone. The resolved HI clumps follow standard HI mass-star formation rate and mass-size relations, with those forming stars reaching surface densities above the threshold for self-shielding. We conclude that AGC 226178 is a free-floating HI cloud of unknown origin. The system appears to be in the process of disintegration. It is likely located well outside the Virgo cluster, as the preservation of its extended HI morphology within the cluster environment would otherwise require a substantial reservoir of unseen molecular gas with a mass exceeding that of the observed HI content. While confinement pressure from the hot intracluster medium may aid its stability, it is unlikely to be the dominant factor preventing its disruption.\n",

      "  - The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1-100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. A UV integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph capable of resolving galaxies across these scales is necessary--and uniquely achievable with the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory.

The observed $M_{\\rm cluster, max}$-$M_{\\rm cloud}$ relation can be interpreted theoretically on the basis of the integrated cloud-wide IMF (ICIMF) theory, which provides a quantitative framework for understanding the correlations between molecular clouds and their internal stellar populations.\n",
